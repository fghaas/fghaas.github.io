  <div>
    <p>In my now almost 10ish years of first running my own company, and then
managing a team in the company I sold my company to, I have very
frequently struggled with what’s a “fair” way of paying people. </p>
<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that when it comes to hiring distributed,
and thus hiring people living in different countries, there is no such
thing. At least not one that everyone agrees on to be fair. The best
thing we can hope for is an approximation of fairness.</p>
<h1>How much do you earn?</h1>
<p>If I ask you how much you make, you’ll either</p>
<ul>
<li>be very offended at the invasion of your privacy, and refuse to
  answer, or</li>
<li>give me an answer straight away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which it is, is likely going to be determined by your culture and your
upbringing. I am Austrian, I have interacted a lot with Americans, and
now I work with Swedes — I can tell you, there are <em>very</em> different
views on this.</p>
<p>Whether or not you choose to answer, you’ll likely have a number in
your head. And again, there are multiple ways you’ll think of that.</p>
<ul>
<li>It could be your annual salary, before income tax.</li>
<li>It could be your monthly salary, before income tax and public
  healthcare and pension payments.</li>
<li>It could be really weird, as in Austria: you’d think of your
  “monthly” salary, but in reality that’s 1/14th rather than 1/12th of
  your annual salary, because you’re paid a double salary in June and
  November.</li>
</ul>
<p>But whichever it is, you’d probably think of a number, in your home
currency.</p>
<h1>Equal work, equal pay. Right?</h1>
<p>I hope we generally agree that two people who do the same (or
equivalent) work should be paid the same. And as long as you’re
comparing two people, living in the same place, whose salary is paid
out in the same currency, that’s easy.</p>
<p>But what about people from different countries? We can even assume
that those two countries use the same currency, to facilitate the
discussion. (Talking about <em>different</em> currencies makes things even
more murky, and is perhaps a topic for another article.)</p>
<p>What’s the actual “worth” of the money you make?</p>
<p>There’s no correct answer for this. There are two possible approaches,
both of which are “wrong” in a way and “right” in another. Let’s say
we’re talking about two people being paid 3,000 euros a month, one
living in Finland, one in Greece.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You could say that a euro is a euro. Thus, if you’ve got € 3,000 in
  your hand in Finland, that’s the same as having € 3,000 in Greece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or you could look at the question, what does that euro buy? If
  you’ve got € 3,000 in Finland, that will buy you things that, on
  average, you need to spend only about € 2,080 euros on in Greece.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So look at two people, one living in Finland and one in Greece. You
pay them both € 3,000 for the same work. Are you paying them equally,
or not?</p>
<p>I think you wouldn’t. If I had a person working for me in Finland, and
I paid that person € 3,000, and another person in Greece that also
made € 3,000 for the same work, I’d be massively short-changing the
person in Finland.</p>
<p>But you can argue that € 3,000 is € 3,000 and that’s the end of the
story. I tend to think that economists are on my side — that’s why the
concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">purchasing power
parity</a> (PPP)
exists —, but you can certainly be of the opposite opinion.<sup id="fnref:inflation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:inflation">1</a></sup></p>
<p>And then there’s the problem that most PPP conversion rates are
per-country. And they may be way off if you compare, say, someone
living in Athens to someone living in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84teritsiputeritsipuolilautatsij%C3%A4nk%C3%A4">Äteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsijänkä</a>,
to stick with the Greece and Finland example.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, neither approach is perfect, and I can only
choose one approach or the other. And the approach that I’ve chosen,
in the distributed team that I run, is to make PPP adjustments. Others
opt for a different approach. Neither of these is right, or
wrong. They’re both an attempt to treat your people equally, and
neither is perfect.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:inflation">
<p>I will put forward one small thought though: if you are
convinced that the money you earn is just that number in your
currency (as in, € 3,000 is € 3,000), then I posit that you should
also stick to that opinion in the face of inflation. Under that
assumption, then € 3,000 next year is still the same € 3,000 it
was this year, regardless of whether inflation was maybe 5%. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:inflation" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
