    <p>After <a href="../../../../../resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/">No, We Won’t Have a Video Call for
That</a>, which
covered how productive distributed teams operate, and the <a href="../../../../../blog/2021/09/30/getting-out-of-meeting-hell/">Getting out
of Meeting Hell</a> series,
which focused on how <em>you</em> as an individual can get to being a member
of a functional distributed team, let’s zoom out a bit.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss a slightly larger, organizational picture, just in case
you ask yourself this question: “<strong>Why isn’t my organization
distributed and asynchronous?</strong> And, as companies <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28833394">bleed talent right
and left</a> because
competent people run for the competition that <em>does</em> get distributed
work right, why don’t they wake up and <em>become</em> like that?  <strong>Can
someone please make my company more distributed and asynchronous?”</strong></p>
<p>For additional context, let me interject the following observations
from <a href="https://blog.koehntopp.info/">Kris Köhntopp</a>, who posted them
<a href="https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1451497494303711234">in German on
Twitter</a> (I am
taking the liberty to translate here; emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s funny is that [what matters to being successful as a
distributed company] are all learnable skills — written
communications, sensible meeting prep and follow-up, correct
definition of objectives and tasks, etc.</p>
<p><strong>That’s a craft.</strong></p>
<p>But it appears that organizations prefer to bleed their teams dry by
attrition, rather than to learn, or to hire people that can help
teams to write things down, professionally maintain a wiki, and
teach and drive communications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1451508098779258889">further
downthread</a>,
Kris says (again, my translation and emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is all definitely feasible, after all there’s remote-first
companies of substantial size and they work.</p>
<p>They must have <strong>built</strong> themselves somehow, they didn’t get to
where they are by pure chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with all of that (obviously), but things are complicated. So
let’s drill into this a bit.</p>
<h2>Building is easy. Changing is hard.</h2>
<p>I’ve founded and bootstrapped a distributed company, and I’ve also
been involved in making a localized company more distributed. Take my
word for it: founding was daunting and scary and stressful, but in
terms of shaping structure and communications — even if you have to
figure it out as you go, as I did with my cofounders<sup id="fnref:invent"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:invent">1</a></sup> — it’s <em>easy.</em>
Changing the communication structure of an established company is
<em>hard.</em> And slow. Even if you have full support from the top.</p>
<p>So, if you’re in an organization that wasn’t distributed from the
get-go, do not compare it to one that was.</p>
<p>Also, do not compare it to one that is two years ahead of yours in
reshaping itself in a distributed and asynchronous manner. Also, if
your company went distributed kicking and screaming at the start of
the pandemic, do not compare it to one where the top leadership made a
conscious decision to be more “remote friendly” or “remote first” or
whatever their preferred term is, long before the pandemic hit. These
organizations are ahead of yours. Their change may be happening just
as slowly as yours, they just started the race earlier and are a
couple of laps ahead of you.</p>
<p>But your company hasn’t even <em>started</em> the change to distributed and
async work? You spent the last nearly two years in unfettered meeting
hell?  Your bosses think you’ll now go “back to normal”, because an
office is the only “normal” they know? <a href="../../../../../blog/2021/10/01/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-employees/">You know what to
do.</a></p>
<h2>Hiring people to help: aye, there’s the rub.</h2>
<p>Now on to the idea of hiring people to help. There’s two ways to look
at that: hiring people as employed <strong>managers</strong> to work and lead in
the organization in a distributed and async fashion, or hiring people
as management <strong>consultants</strong> to guide and advise the company in the
distributed and async transition.</p>
<p>(Please note: the idea of hiring only <em>regular employees</em> that drive a
distributed and async change “from within” — against the resistance or
inertia of established management — is ludicrous, unethical, and
unworkable.)</p>
<h3>Hire distie managers?</h3>
<p>If you make it a priority to hire managers geared toward distributed and
asynchronous work, then if they’re worth their salt I can guarantee you
that one of the first things that they’ll ask in their first interview
is this:</p>
<p>“What’s <em>my</em> line manager’s (director’s, VP’s, etc) distributed and
async work experience? How about my lateral peers’?”</p>
<p>And if the truthful answer is “they’re new to this,” it’s quite likely
that your prospective new management colleague will politely end the
conversation. Their skills are in high demand; they have plenty of
options to go elsewhere. Why should sign they up for a job that’s
going to come with a ton of needless friction?</p>
<p>And of course, that consideration applies in all management positions,
all the way to the top. So for this to work, in an organization
currently hellbent on localized-synchronized work (I use
<em>offissification</em> for that state of affairs), it would need at least
its entire
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_title#Senior_management">C-suite</a>
to come around first. And it would then <em>probably</em> need to replace at
least one-third of its current managers at all levels, to have any
chance of attracting fresh blood in management.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that this isn’t exactly easy to do, plus it’ll probably
take longer than you have the patience to put up with it.</p>
<h3>Hire management consultants?</h3>
<p>So that leaves the option of hiring people that are <em>not</em> part of the
organization but are brought in to advise, ideally on all management
levels. These people are called management consultants. And you should
understand that they are commonly <em>loathed</em> by mid-level line
managers. But let’s leave that aside for now. Let’s assume that you
want to consider the possibility of a management consultant whose
communication skills and empathy and talent are so outstanding that
they are absolutely not hated by anybody.</p>
<p>Then, please put yourself in that consultant’s shoes. Before they get
anywhere near you, they would have spent countless hours in — you
guessed it — <em>meetings</em> with the CEO, with top-level management,
possibly with department heads, to get <em>buy-in</em>. And then, they embark
on a multi-month project where they must use the style of work
currently prevalent in your company, because that’s the only way to
even approach people. So they spend more time in — are you with me —
<em>meetings</em> to convince and educate people. Oh, and they probably need
to bill by the day or by the hour, in some arbitrary increment that
your bean counters dictate, because otherwise they can’t get
paid. Async work, on your own time and schedule, much?</p>
<p>So that means that under most circumstances, such a project will
either involve a person who’s actually perfectly fine with localized
and synchronous work, and for this kind of project that’s <em>probably</em>
not a person you’d want to hire. Or else they’re miserably
unproductive throughout the project, and that doesn’t exactly bode
well for their health <em>nor</em> your project. (Which means a person
understanding this probably will never start such a consultancy in the
first place.)</p>
<p>Now, I want to mention that I suppose from the perspective of a
consultant, there is one way to square this circle: charge exorbitant
rates. If you can make a killing working two days a month, and you
actually <em>do</em> work just two days of meeting hell per month and take
the rest of your time off to recuperate, then that might actually
work. But then it’s less likely — not impossible, but less likely —
that your company will retain their services. Because unlike a
consultant that you bring in to chop heads, monetary gains (that is,
return on investment for the consultant’s fees) are much more
difficult to put in numbers when you’re “only” making everyone’s life
better, and attracting better employees, increasing productivity,
building better products, attracting more customers, and hence making
a bigger profit are mere knock-on effects from that.<sup id="fnref:rational"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rational">2</a></sup></p>
<h2>So, how do things change, then?</h2>
<p>It’s my rather firm belief that these things change by evolution, not
on an organizational scale but on one of market and society. <strong>Many of
the companies still stuck in the office mindset will not change,</strong> at
least not dramatically. They will continue to bleed talent, not
attract much fresh blood, and face fierce competition from companies
that do better and attract good people. Some will undergo a slow and
sometimes painful transition and some will succeed at it. Some will
fail and go under, or become irrelevant.</p>
<p>But expecting dramatic, sudden change at a large organization is just
not realistic. And if you’re stuck in one that’s still pretending that
this’ll all blow over, your best option is probably to make a change
for yourself, than to try to wait for one in your organization.</p>

<p>This is not to say that we <em>invented</em> anything, just that
we had to figure out how to make things work for ourselves that
already worked for others. Distributed
companies existed well before my cofounders and I started a
company in 2011. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB">MySQL
AB</a> (incidentally, Kris
Köhntopp’s former employer) established those practices in the
2000-2005 time frame. There is an excellent <a href="https://youtu.be/2xmEgtRhw7o">November 2011
talk</a> from ex-MySQL CEO Mårten
Mickos, in which he runs through the entire history of MySQL as an
independent company, until its acquisition by Sun in 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/2xmEgtRhw7o?t=1653">Around
the 27-minute mark</a>, he

<p>And <em>even if</em> there is a demonstrable expected positive
<em>monetary</em> effect, meaning in terms of numbers it’s an absolute
no-brainer, you should consider that top management <em>are people,</em>
and people don’t always act rationally. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rational" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>
