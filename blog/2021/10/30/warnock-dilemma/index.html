  <div>
    <p>People skeptical of distributed, asynchronous, written communications
sometimes make the understandable objection that it is often
difficult to interpret the reactions, specifically the <em>absence of</em>
reactions, to written online communications. </p>
<p>The reasoning goes like this: if you inform someone of something in a
face-to-face conversation, there is practically no way for them <em>not</em>
to provide some sort of feedback. Even if the recipient of a verbal
message doesn’t say a word, they usually exhibit some unconscious,
nonverbal reaction, which can carry a whole load of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person might smile, light up, and become actively engaged,</li>
<li>they might express surprise (pleasant or unpleasant),</li>
<li>they may show signs of dismay or annoyance, or even anger,</li>
<li>they might just stare or wander off, indicating disconnection or
  indifference,</li>
<li>or anything in between.</li>
</ul>
<p>In online, textual communications, people obviously <em>also</em> exhibit all
those reactions, sitting at their desk, lounging on their couch,
walking with their phone — it’s just that the sender of the message
usually never gets to see them. </p>
<p>In addition, a face-to-face conversation is a one-to-one communication
mode that we direct our undivided attention to. In contrast, textual
online communications are often many-to-many, and we usually get many
more parallel inputs than we do when we’re speaking to a colleague or
acquaintance or friend.</p>
<p>That means that while in a face-to-face conversation we’re <em>always</em>
answering, or at least showing our reaction to what was said, in online
textual communications we must <em>pick and choose</em> what to react to, and
what to just absorb without providing any kind of feedback to the
message sender.</p>
<h2>Warnock’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>In online communities this has been known since at least 2000, when
Bryan Warnock
<a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/2000/08/msg1127.html">formulated</a>
it as “the ostrich theory”, although it eventually <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2001/02/msg2562.html">was
named</a>
“Warnock’s Dilemma”<sup id="fnref:pentalemma"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:pentalemma">1</a></sup> by Dave Mitchell. Writing about
mailing list posts without replies, Bryan wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with no response is that there are five possible
interpretations:</p>
<p>1) The post is correct, well-written information that needs no
follow-up commentary.  There’s nothing more to say except “Yeah,
what he said.”</p>
<p>2) The post is complete and utter nonsense, and no one wants to
waste the energy or bandwidth to even point this out.</p>
<p>3) No one read the post, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>4) No one understood the post, but won’t ask for clarification, for
whatever reason.</p>
<p>5) No one cares about the post, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>— Bryan Warnock, “<a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/2000/08/msg1127.html">Re: RFCs: two proposals for
change</a>”,
perl.bootstrap mailing list, 2000-08-07</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In asynchronous and distributed work communications, we have much the
same issue. The beautifully crafted <a href="../../../../../blog/2021/10/27/this-meeting-should-have-been-an-email/">five-paragraph
briefing</a> that
you sent out this morning may have been considered manna from heaven
by your recipients (if you’re a manager, your recipients are usually
your direct reports), and they immediately sprung into action
energized by your electrifying leadership. Or maybe nobody understood
a word of the unintelligible drivel you concocted, but out of respect
or courtesy they are very hesitant to point this out.</p>
<p>So in my humble opinion, there are two very simple things you can do
as a manager to address Warnock’s Dilemma in your distributed team:
making it a habit to specifically encourage objections, and
establishing a culture of acknowledgements.</p>
<h2>Encouraging objections</h2>
<p>The habit I have developed to encourage objections is to not merely
ask the recipients of a message to raise questions if they have them,
but to ask them to poke holes in whatever I’ve been writing.</p>
<p>To that end, I have standing phrases that I use, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Do you think that sounds reasonable?”</li>
<li>“Did I overlook something important?”</li>
<li>“Can you think of a better way to do this?” (Better than my
  suggestion, that is.)</li>
<li>“I’m pretty sure I’m missing something here, can you pitch in?”</li>
<li>“Am I way out in left field with this?”</li>
<li>“How nuts of an idea is this?”</li>
</ul>
<p>I might use a variation on one or several of these phrases at the end
of an email, but also in the comments section of a wiki page (or in
individual inline comments), or even in the reply thread of an issue
tracker.</p>
<p>This serves multiple purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are many individual areas of knowledge where someone on my
   team is more of an expert than I am. Obviously, I want those
   people’s ideas on the table.</li>
<li>It establishes the notion that nobody’s opinions or suggestions on
   technical matters are sacrosanct, and we want to do <em>the right
   thing</em> in any situation, not follow the hippo.<sup id="fnref:hippo"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hippo">2</a></sup></li>
<li>It encourages others to ask for feedback in the same manner,
   whenever they float ideas or suggestions of their own.</li>
<li>It establishes that there’s nothing wrong with being wrong from
   time to time.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>So now, on to acknowledgements, that is, what to do when you have <em>no</em>
objections on something.</p>
<p>Here’s a general rule that I use: <strong>all communications should be
acknowledged.</strong> Yes, really. Anything my team sends me, I try to reply
to with at least “ack” or “OK”, but frequently it’s something like
“great, thanks!” — it costs nothing to be kind.</p>
<p>Likewise, for everything I send <em>to</em> my team I can count on getting
the same kind of reply back. There’s something I need to pass on from
higher up? Or just something I want everyone to know? Out goes an
email, in come a few “ack” replies over the next few hours. I don’t
even have to specifically ask anyone for acknowledgement anymore, it
just happens.<sup id="fnref:guidelines"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:guidelines">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In this context, we deliberately use <em>written</em> acknowledgements — as
in, somebody actually <em>types</em> something, even if it’s just the two
letters “OK”. I find Like buttons or thumbs-up or email “read
receipts” (anyone remember those?) oddly perfunctory.</p>
<p>This has a nice side effect, in combination with encouraging
objections: someone who — while knowing that objections are always
encouraged — acknowledges an idea, opinion, or plan, <em>actually makes
it clear that they are on board with it.</em></p>
