    <p>Fellow managers, there is an ongoing trope in just about any software
technology or knowledge based organization (and probably others, too)
that goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This meeting should have been an email.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s such a well-established meme at this point that you <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/shop/i+survived+another+meeting+that+should+have+been+an+email+mugs">can buy mugs
saying
so</a>. Or
<a href="https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/737148259/i-survived-another-meeting-that-could">cross-stitched “award
certificates”</a>,
or
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/8z31wz/office_participation/">ribbons</a>. And
yet, many of you appear to dismiss it as a nerdy joke, and refuse to
take the sentiment behind it seriously.</p>
<p>And this even though you may <em>agree</em> that your organization has too
many meetings.  Even that <em>you</em> are in too many meetings. But you’re
convinced that sadly, sadly you can’t cancel <em>that</em> meeting. Or that
one. Or the quarterly financials update. Or the update about the
shakeup in the CTO office. Or the meeting explaining at <em>your</em> level
what the CEO just communicated to everyone via a video message or an
email of their own.</p>
<p>You can do it. I’m here to help.</p>
<h2>“Email” means any structured, written communication that allows for feedback</h2>
<p>Let’s set one thing straight to begin with.</p>
<p>The standing phrase is “this meeting should have been an email”
because that’s catchy. But that’s not to say that you actually need to
write an email message. What it really means is that to communicate
whatever it is that you’re trying to get across, you use a medium that</p>
<ol>
<li>uses written expression,</li>
<li>allows you to formulate complex thoughts and reasoning in writing,</li>
<li>allows people to comment and share feedback, in writing,</li>
<li>ideally allows for that feedback to subsequently be worked back into
   the original writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll see that particularly considering item #4, email isn’t even the
best option available at your disposal. Instead, you can look at the
following, additional options, all of which will probably be available
to you in some form:</p>
<ul>
<li>a shared flow-text document, like a <a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310248?hl=en#6.3">Google Doc</a>, a collaboratively edited
  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/collaborate-on-word-documents-with-real-time-co-authoring-7dd3040c-3f30-4fdd-bab0-8586492a1f1d">Office 365 Word
  document</a>,
  or a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-introduces-collaborative-rich-text-editor/">Nextcloud
  Text</a>
  document,</li>
<li>a page in your organization’s wiki, like
  <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> or
  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a>,</li>
<li>or even a barebones shared text editor, like
  <a href="https://etherpad.org/">Etherpad</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So all of these are good.<sup id="fnref:chat"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:chat">1</a></sup> All of them are better than a meeting. With
near certainty at least one of them is available at your disposal.</p>
<h2>Meetings burn people’s time</h2>
<p>Meetings are gigantic time consumers. And the productivity gains from
switching to well-structured written communications are <strong>enormous</strong>.</p>
<p>To illustrate, allow me to offer some first-hand experience. When I’m
being called to attend a meeting, my colleagues will attest to the
fact that I am a meticulous note-taker. I write meetings up in our
corporate wiki, and I record notes, rather than producing a verbatim
transcript. But I can guarantee you that I will write down every point
that the attendees make that’s worth remembering or referring back
to. This includes some key points that I do record word-for-word. I’ve
been in meetings with 20 attendees of 1 hour in length. My meeting
notes <em>never</em> go over 2,000 words for such a meeting, and usually
they’re more like 1,000 words. So that means that for a meeting that
burns 20 person-hours <em>just to attend</em> (that is, not including meeting
prep), what actually gets said can be summarized in 2,000 words, tops.</p>
<p>Now, consider that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X19300786">the average silent reading rate for English
speakers</a>
is approximately 240 words per minute. So people can read a 2,000-word
summary in under 9 minutes, a 1,000 word one in about 4. In other
words, by conveying the information in writing rather than orally, you
can eliminate five-sixths to fourteen-fifteenths of that useless
overhead. Or put differently, <strong>replacing an hourlong meeting with a
well-written briefing gives each and every person 6 to 15 times more
productivity.</strong> And that’s not even counting the benefits of
eliminating the meeting as a forced synchronization point.</p>
<h2>But writing things up means more work for me!</h2>
<p>You may argue that although you understand that putting together a
well-written briefing (instead of calling a meeting) saves everyone
<em>else</em> time, it takes up more of <em>your</em> time.</p>
<p>Let me observe this: If you’ve been convening and chairing meetings of
an hour, and you haven’t been spending <em>about</em> as much time preparing
for that meeting yourself, then I’m sorry to break it you but you may
not have been a very conscientious meeting chair all along. In fact,
you may have be been rather disrespectful of other people’s time, and
now is a very good time for you to change.</p>
<p>If however you <em>have</em> been a conscientious meeting chair and every
one-hour meeting did, in aggregate, consume about one hour of meeting
prep (including scheduling, collecting information, and preparing it
so you have it all ready to go), then rejoice: the onerous
scheduling-and-roping-everyone-in bit is gone, so that saves up a
sizable chunk of <em>your</em> time, and you can punch out 1,000 to 2,000
words in 30-45 minutes. So, <em>less</em> work for you. Admittedly, not as
dramatically so for you (the writer) as for your erstwhile attendees
(now readers), but still pretty substantial.</p>
<p>(Not to mention the fact that <em>team</em> productivity gains in the
order-of-magnitude range, see above, should make your heart jump with
joy.)</p>
<h2>OK but how? I don’t know where to start!</h2>
<p><a href="../../../../../resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/">I’ve written about this
before</a>, but I’d
like to come back to this again: if you’re looking for guidelines on
structuring your writing for what you would otherwise communicate in
your meetings, look at the 5-paragraph briefing format, adapted from
the NATO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_paragraph_order">5-paragraph field
order</a>. If you
make it your habit to at least <em>think</em> about this format, chances are
that your briefing will be pretty damn comprehensive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Situation</li>
<li>Objective</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Logistics</li>
<li>Communications</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s break these down in a little detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>Situation is about what position we’re in, and <strong>why</strong> we set out
   to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three
   sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your
   own company, any extra help that is available, and the current
   market.</li>
<li>Objective is <strong>what</strong> we want to achieve.</li>
<li>Plan is <strong>how</strong> we want to achieve it.</li>
<li>Logistics is about what budget and resources are available, and how
   we can use them.</li>
<li>Communications is about how we’ll be coordinating among ourselves
   and with others in order to achieve our goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes you want to give not a full briefing, but a simple update,
such as because circumstances have changed. In that case, you may only
include the first three items, and the changes that apply to it.</p>
<p>It’s good practice to <em>always</em> include these three (that is,
situation, objective, and plan): to <em>you</em> it may be clear and obvious
that since the situation has changed, a slight modification of the
plan (or the objective!) is necessary. To others, it might not. So
just always include the current situation, the current objectives, and
the current plan.</p>
<p>You can also apply this to a problem statement, where it’s just as
useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is what we’re currently dealing with, and how I see it (that’s
   the <em>situation</em>)</li>
<li>Here’s why it’s a problem, and why it needs to be fixed (that’s an
   <em>objective</em>)</li>
<li>This is my suggestion for how it could be fixed (that’s a <em>plan</em>)</li>
</ol>
<h2>And finally, some poetry</h2>
<p>And as my final writing tip for improving communications and
eliminating needless meetings, I want to leave you with some
poetry. These lines that just so happen to serve as a perfect mnemonic
for professional briefings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I keep six honest serving-men:<br/>
(They taught me all I knew)<br/>
Their names are What and Where and When<br/>
And How and Why and Who.  </p>
<p>— Rudyard Kipling, The Elephant’s Child, 1902</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strive for all your professional writing to answer most or all of
<em>what,</em> <em>where,</em> <em>when,</em> <em>how,</em> <em>why,</em> and <em>who,</em> and watch your need
for meetings evaporate like morning dew in glistening sunlight.</p>
