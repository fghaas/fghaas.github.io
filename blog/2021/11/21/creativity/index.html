  <div>
    <p>Right now, it’s easy to open a news site and come to the conclusion
that the world as we know it is well and truly fucked. It doesn’t
matter if you’re looking at Covid response, or inaction on climate
change, or corruption, or communications surveillance: it increasingly
looks like we are being governed and managed overwhelmingly by
dunderheads just bumbling along, equipped with less than the most
basic empathy, and lacking the mental faculties required to understand
exponential growth or conditional probability or even percentages. And
people — <em>intelligent</em> people — are seriously pondering the situation
with utter befuddlement: how the hell did we get here?</p>
<p>The German writer <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_Buddenbohm">Max
Buddenbohm</a>
recently asked his followers a question to that effect <a href="https://twitter.com/Buddenbohm/status/1460124921993084929">on
Twitter</a>,
which I am taking the liberty to translate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have a reflected opinion on why everything is so poorly
organized, as in at its core? Historically or sociologically, what’s
the real principal reason? How did this happen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it’s perhaps a bit amusing and stereotypically German to complain
of <span class="fraktur">ſchlechte Organiſation!</span> in
the middle of a pandemic and global climate cataclysm, but the
sentiment behind the question is sound: it looks as though at every
twist and turn, those empowered to make any kind of decision make the
wrong one, or none at all, or — the worst — aren’t even able to come
up with sensible <em>options</em> between which to choose.</p>
<p>And I have a hypothesis: I think the issue at the core of why
everything appears to be going down the tubes is that <strong>we have
systematically drummed creativity out of people,</strong> for at least fifty
years. And as a result, we collectively have no idea how we can get
ourselves out of a rut.</p>
<p>Let me swiftly explain what I mean by “creativity.”</p>
<p>The wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_(educationalist)">Sir Ken
Robinson</a>,
who left us much too soon in 2020, described creativity as “the
process of having original ideas that have value.” And in arguing for
the value of creativity, we don’t need to get all hippy-touchy-feely:
creativity — and <em>teaching and learning</em> creativity — is a simple
economic necessity that is also essential to our survival as a
species.</p>
<p>If we have no idea what our world will look like ten years — or even
ten <em>months</em> — from now, then how the hell is any “hard skill” we
acquire today <em>guaranteed</em> to be useful in future challenges? The
paramount faculty we need to acquire, train, and nurture is the
ability to come up with flexible, intelligent, <em>creative</em> solutions to
the problems we’ll encounter tomorrow.</p>
<hr/>
<p>And this we haven’t been doing. From an early age onwards, generation
after generation has been schooled in “the right way” to do things.
And since “the right way” exists only for things we already know, we
are now ensnared in a trap called conformity that is no good at all in
the present situation where so many of us are confronted with things we
haven’t a clue about.</p>
<p>To illustrate what I mean, allow me to offer an anecdote from my own
personal family experience. When my son, who is now nearly an adult,
was a nine-year-old pupil in his fourth year of primary schooling, he
started to be tasked with writing little stories — it would be an
exaggeration to call them “essays” at that point — in school. And,
given the fact that he was quite an imaginative kid, the first couple
of stories he wrote were truly charming and delightful. But after a
few weeks, something strange happened: his stories were getting rather
bland and boring, and were hardly a reflection of his vivid
imagination anymore. So as his parents, we gently queried about this
mysterious phenomenon — and he was quite happy and forthcoming to
explain the reason. He had observed, he informed us, that the fellow
pupils of his that had got good marks and the teacher’s appreciation
on the first stories they had written were the ones that had turned in
the writing with the fewest spelling and grammar mistakes. And
apparently he resolved then and there to henceforth only turn in
stories that were composed of sentences strung together from words he
already knew how to spell, using constructions that he was already
familiar with — and that he was thus unlikely to stuff up. Of course
that made <em>reading</em> the stories about as exciting as watching paint
dry, but it kept the teacher happy and thus, off his back.</p>
<p>And I can attest that this very much goes for my own schooling as
well. It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about my German classes or
English classes or French classes, “correctness” always prevailed over
originality or wit or creativity. I don’t mean to insinuate that
clever writing should get you a free pass to absolutely butcher your
spelling and grammar, but then on the other hand perfect orthography
and punctuation did always make up for abject boredom, and that’s not
quite right either. And this wasn’t restricted to just language
classes: in maths exams there was no extra credit to be had for
arriving at the correct solution of a problem in a novel or
unconventional way. Nay, such brazen nonconformity would net you
either a reprimand from the teacher for not showing the correct <em>path</em>
to the solution, or at least a snide remark of the “oh you think
you’re very clever don’t you, now sit down and behave” type.</p>
<p>My English and French and German teachers appear to have been unaware
of <em>another</em> fact related to their institutional correctness
obsession. Consider this: people who actually make a living from
writing — no matter if it’s fiction or non-fiction — tend to work with
<em>editors,</em> people whose calling it is to not only correct issues with
orthography or punctuation, but also to helpfully point out plot holes
and suggest the occasional rewrite of dialogue or rearrangement of
chapters. Editors are highly respected by writers and instrumental to
the success of a book but yet, strangely, these people’s names are
normally not printed in bold letters across the book cover, and they
also don’t appear in best seller lists. If my language teachers had
been correct, editors should be celebrity superstars! And they should
hold far greater prestige than the silly authors who only come up with
the storylines but regularly struggle with the placement of a
semicolon.</p>
<p>And the problem with the idea that errors are awful, and the fact that
that idea is being hammered into our heads from an early age, is that
this has a devastating effect on our creative imagination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being
creative. What we do know is: if you’re not prepared to be wrong,
you’ll never come up with anything original.</p>
<p>— Ken Robinson, “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity">Do schools kill
creativity?</a>”
(2006)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you want people to be boring and dull and utterly devoid of
originality, then foster a culture where being error-free is
paramount.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the business world, some tend to look down on others who have a
tenuous relationship with spelling and grammar and punctuation,
chiding such deficiencies as “unprofessional.” But at the same time,
it’s commonly accepted to be dragged into a meeting and then forced to
listen to someone drone on for an hour in a narcotic monologue
consisting of the recitation of thirty-four wall-of-text slides with
precisely seven bullet points each, in a ferocious assault on
everyone’s attention and consciousness that gives an overdose of
Valium a run for its money. How, pray tell, is it ever “professional”
to steal people’s precious lifetime by boring them out of their
fucking minds? And yet, this is somehow acceptable behavior in the
world of business.</p>
<p>Let me add another bit of anecdotal first-hand experience: a few years
ago when I was making most of my living as a travelling technical
consultant, I was often brought in to help a team of engineers chart a
path for solving a particular problem using one of the technologies I
knew a little bit about. And in doing so, some decisions frequently
boiled down to two choices, which I was always happy to lay out in
detail: here is option A, it comes with these advantages and
disadvantages, and here’s option B, it comes with <em>those</em> advantages
and disadvantages. And I would explain to my client that it is now
their <em>business</em> decision to determine whether the pros of A outweigh
the pros of B <em>for their business,</em> and whether or not they would be
able to live with the cons of whatever option they chose.</p>
<p>And inevitably, the reactions to this nearly always fell into one of
two categories.</p>
<p>The first category was gratitude for me having laid out the options
clearly and distilled the pros and cons of each, informed by my
technical expertise on the matter and my understanding of their
situation. And the business decision was either completely obvious to
them, or they appreciated having a good <em>basis</em> on which to make a
decision, which they resolved to make in the following days or weeks,
presumably after some more empirical, experimental evaluation.</p>
<p>And the second category was complete confusion on a person’s face,
followed by the exasperated question, “so what do you recommend?” Or,
worse, “what’s the right way?”</p>
<p>You can probably guess which category of answers was more likely to
come from managers — or “leaders”, as such people like to be called
in a <a href="../../../../../blog/2019/04/21/non-technical/">gross exaggeration of their
capabilities</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>And now imagine someone having gone through a conventional primary and
secondary education, then continued on to university and from there
into business or the law, or maybe the academic Ph.D. track, while in
parallel having risen through the ranks of that cult of rigidity and
conformism called a political party — and ultimately entering
public office.</p>
<p>On that note, another illustrative anecdote. Not from myself or my
family but still close to home: you may remember how early in the
Covid-19 pandemic in February 2020, the Tyrolean ski resort of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischgl#COVID-19_pandemic_hotspot">Ischgl</a>
became Central Europe’s <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/ischgl-oesterreichisches-skiparadies-als-corona-hotspot/">first major infection
hotspot</a>,
directly linked to at least 600 cases in Austria and more than twice
as many across Europe. (At the time, 1,800 confirmed Covid cases
seemed like a lot. As I write this, we have about 10 times as
many. <em>Per day.</em>) The universal understanding of the majority of
observers at the time — and today — was that the situation on the
ground had been horribly botched, and that egregious mistakes were
made that greatly facilitated the spread of Covid-19 across Europe.</p>
<p>The official in charge of public health in the provincial cabinet then
<a href="https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000115833853/alles-richtig-gemacht-entlarvendes-interview-mit-tirolergesundheitslandesrat-tilg-in-der">went on national news a couple of weeks
later</a>
to discuss the events. And, despite the repeated questions from the
exasperated interviewer, voiced with increasing levels of disbelief,
the official kept insisting that the authorities had “done everything
right” and were not to be faulted at all for their actions — and
inactions — in this public health emergency.</p>
<p>And I don’t even think that this was just hubris or an attempted
cover-up. Rather, it’s a symptom of the exact problem I’m trying to
describe. If you’re applying only <em>what you already know</em> to a
situation that’s never been here before, you’re failing horribly at
dealing with that situation. But if you’ve been conditioned that
applying “the correct solution” is all you’ll ever have to do in life
to succeed, you eventually end up genuinely believing that that’s
enough.</p>
<p>And that’s how, in the greatest crisis that humanity has faced in
peacetime in over a century, what we’re stuck with are leaders who,
for the most part, have been so thoroughly molded by the perpetual
vicious cycle of conformism that they now operate with the
decisiveness and agility of a herd of mammoths deep-frozen in
permafrost. They are just shockingly ill-equipped to deal with a
global health crisis affecting a closely interconnected
civilization. And the ones that actually used creative ways to <em>get</em>
to power turn out to be sociopathic one-trick cronies that could not
apply their skills to something useful if their life depended on it.</p>
<p>It looks as though <em>systematically,</em> those who have the <em>power</em> to
make decisions, at all levels — in business, politics, anywhere —
frequently lack the intellectual, emotional, and empathetic
<strong>creative</strong> capabilities required to make those decisions. This is
not to say that exceptions to this rule don’t exist — I’m lucky enough
to live in a town where officials from the mayor on down have been
exceptionally creative, empathetic, <em>and successful</em> in their Covid
response, for example — but I would argue that the rule does stand.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Now, it would be entirely fair to counter my arguments with the
observation that surely, in the say 1950s or 1930s or 1910s schooling
and education were still more rigid than they are today, and certainly
did not allow for <em>more</em> creative freedom than they do now. And that
is certainly true, but there is something that children (at least
those lucky enough to <em>go</em> to school, I am aware that for those who
spent their childhood toiling in the fields or coal mines it was an
entirely different story) had during their schooling in those days
that is a precious rarity today: time and space to let their mind
play.</p>
<p>John Cleese writes in his <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50719532-creativity">excellent book on
creativity</a>
that <em>mental play</em> — the ability to let your mind wander and thereby
become open to developing new ideas — is a key element of the creative
process. And this is by no means limited to music or literature or the
arts; some of the examples he lists of mental playfulness leading to
groundbreaking new ideas are from the world of science. Now, it is
essential to be able to keep our mind in that state of playfulness for
some time, because it takes a little while for new ideas to pop into
our head. And so, Cleese observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest killer of creativity is interruption. It pulls your
mind away from what you want to be thinking about. […] It might be
an interruption from outside, like someone coming over and talking
to you, or an email popping up in your inbox. Or it may come from
inside, as when you suddenly remember something you’ve forgotten to
do, or worry that time is running out, or that you don’t think
you’re clever enough to solve whatever problem it is you’re trying
to deal with.</p>
<p>— John Cleese, “Creativity: A Short and Cheerful Guide” (2020)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is the bit that’s incredibly difficult to achieve for most
people born after about 1970, and many born earlier too. That includes
any child alive today, but also their parents and many of their
grandparents. We are <em>constantly</em> dealing with outside interruptions,
many of them coming from a device we carry in our pockets all day. We
have to fight for our uninterrupted mental play time. A child in the
1950s might just run off to play with friends for the afternoon, and
return home for supper. Without a text from a parent or a snapchat
message from the school bully rudely interrupting halfway
through. It’s perhaps no coincidence that some of those 1950s children
ended up being
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aaron">26-year-olds</a> who could
figure out powering up a disabled spacecraft while it’s on a
free-return trajectory around the Moon, saving the life of a three-man
crew in the process.</p>
<p>There’s more evidence that even in the world of engineering, allowing
your mind to let go for a bit can lead to creative breakthroughs: <a href="https://appel.nasa.gov/2010/09/20/jim-crocker-on-systems-engineering/">Jim
Crocker</a>
was the Ball Aerospace engineer who solved the problem of how exactly
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_Optics_Space_Telescope_Axial_Replacement">corrective
optics</a>
on the Hubble Space Telescope should be installed — obviously not a
scenario that anyone accounted for in Hubble’s design.  The ingenious
idea that ended up saving Hubble from being a multibillion dollar
boondoggle <a href="https://www.ball.com/aerospace/newsroom/features/genius-at-work">came to him in the
shower</a>.</p>
<p>Also, in offices in which we worked with maybe one other colleague in
the room, we had stretches of time where the other person was off
running an errand in town or taking a meeting in a conference
room. And you could close the door and put up a “do not disturb” sign
and do some uninterrupted thinking.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Around the year 2000, most of that started to change, dramatically.
Open-plan offices, which of course were allegedly introduced to
“facilitate cooperation,” eliminated any room for uninterrupted mental
play at work. Emails replaced typed and printed memos, office workers
transitioned from workstations to laptops. Pagers and cell phones
started to buzz people at home. Around 2010 we progressed to smart
phones, tablets and other portable devices that had the ability to
ping us out of playful thought with an audible notification at any
time of day. <em>Knowledge work became interrupt-driven</em> — a sentence
that in itself should make anyone shudder that knows anything about
knowledge work at all.</p>
<p>And it’s no surprise that people who rose to corporate leadership
after being imprinted by an interrupt-driven lifestyle — that is,
people now in their 50s — think that such a thing is <em>normal,</em> and try
to impress the same thing on their subordinates. That’s how you get to
Slack-driven companies. That’s how you end up in a culture where
people are proud of getting back to any email within 30 minutes (or
less), and expecting the same from everyone. That’s how you end up
with managers who take being signed into a chat (and thereby
<em>constantly</em> listening for interruptions) as a measure of being
“active”, so much so that they <a href="https://twitter.com/pleia2/status/1456629767743016966">end up tracking metrics for
it</a>, and of
course also <a href="../../../../../blog/2021/11/14/meaningless-metrics-treacherous-targets/">making it a
target</a> they
call “engagement” or some other abomination.</p>
<p>Organizations that do that are at risk of constantly shutting down
creativity, problem-solving, and innovation. What they’re good for is
developing efficient cookie-cutter techniques for optimizing solutions
for <em>yesterday’s</em> issues. What we need <em>today</em> — in a global pandemic,
and in the roiling climate crisis that’ll make this pandemic look like
a walk in the park — is people and organizations equipped with the
mindset for the issues of <em>tomorrow.</em> And a first imperative for
making that happen is to <strong>let people think.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>So is everything all doom and gloom? I’d say it isn’t, and there are
indeed some things that make me hopeful. Some of those are related to
a changed approach to creativity in education, some, to a changing
approach to work.</p>
<p>For example, in my country as of a few years ago it is indeed such
that creativity and originality are accorded at least <em>some</em> merit in
marking and grading standards. And this is at the secondary school
level, traditionally one of the most rigid and unchanging branches of
education where I live. Much more still is happening at the primary
and preschool level, where I see <em>much</em> more emphasis on thinking,
creative play, and innovation in my younger kids’ education than I did
in my older ones’.</p>
<p>And then, there’s the big push towards asynchronous distributed work —
where obviously the <em>asynchronous</em> part is the bit that matters. Sure,
<a href="../../../../../blog/2021/10/23/make-my-company-distributed/">companies suffering from <em>offissification</em></a>
still exist, but for a while, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo">so did
dodos</a>. But an ever-increasing
share of humanity is beginning to understand what it’s like when
you’re no longer shackled to seventeen Slack channels you constantly
need to watch, when you can take a walk in the middle of the day
because you know it’s OK to push something off for an hour to clear
your head and come up with an idea, and when instead of spending an
hour in a meeting <a href="../../../../../blog/2021/10/27/this-meeting-should-have-been-an-email/">you can spend 5 minutes reading a memo and use the
other 55 minutes for
thinking</a>.  And
that’s where things get interesting.</p>
