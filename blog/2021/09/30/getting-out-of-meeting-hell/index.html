    <p>
      Posted on Thu 30 September 2021 in <a href="../../../../../category/blog.html">blog</a>

  <div>
    <p>In 2020, I presented a talk at <a href="https://www.froscon.de">FrOSCon</a>
titled <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/froscon2020-2605-no_we_won_t_have_a_video_call_for_that">No, we won’t have a video call for that: Communications for
distributed
teams.</a>
In early 2021 I put together a full-length writeup of that talk, and
<a href="../../../../../resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/">published it
here</a>. And for no
apparent reason that article then <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28636536">made it to the top of Hacker
News</a> on one day in
September 2021,<sup id="fnref:newsy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:newsy">1</a></sup> and apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/1442371424543444994">resonated with quite a few
people</a>.</p>
<p>And after that, I got a fair number of questions along the lines of
“okay, what you talk about is a spot-on description of how I <em>want</em> to
work, but how do I get there?” In other words, <strong>what can you do in
order to transition from a team that’s stuck in meeting hell, to one
that actually goes fully distributed and embraces asynchronous
communications?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I use the shorthand <em>Meeting Hell</em> for a situation in
which people are forced to be in unnecessary and unproductive video
meetings<sup id="fnref:in-person-meeting"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:in-person-meeting">2</a></sup> for an unhealthy fraction of their work
time.</p>
<p>This is admittedly a mere <em>symptom</em> of not having adopted
asynchronous and distributed ways of working, but it’s such a
tell-tale sign thereof that it counts as a dead giveaway. Thus, I
think it’s okay to say “I’m stuck in meeting hell” when what someone
means is really “I work in an organization that’s failing badly at
distributed and asynchronous work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what I’m doing here is offer <strong>suggestions</strong> for getting out of that. If</p>
<ul>
<li>you’re one of the people that has 25 meetings a week, or</li>
<li>you <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28652514">spend 60% of your work
  week</a> in standups and
  planning and retro, or</li>
<li>the only time you have for doing what you actually signed up for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28653696">is
  in overtime</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>and it’s grinding you down, and you want to work differently, then
this series might be for you.</p>
<h3>Personal strategies: one size does not fit all</h3>
<p>I think it’s very important to <strong>differentiate personal strategies</strong> for
getting to distributed &amp; async, based on your position in the company
or organization. So, I’m going to look at it from three angles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your options if you are what some companies call an “Individual
   Contributor”, or IC. In other words, these are for you if you are a
   <strong>regular employee</strong> (or contractor), and you’re <em>not</em> personally
   responsible for other people — in other words, you have no reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your options if you are at some level of <strong>management</strong> that is
   <em>not</em> top organizational leadership. That is to say, you have
   people that report to you, but you also report to someone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your options if you’re a <strong>top-level executive</strong>, meaning you’re a
   Chief Executive Officer or Managing Director or Executive Director
   or something of the sort. You have people that report to you, but
   you don’t directly report to anyone — even though you may be
   answerable to a Board of Directors or some other oversight body, of
   course.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>These are my views, not self-evident truths</h3>
<p>Now, I’m only going to talk about my industry (software-driven
technology) because that’s the only industry I feel remotely qualified
to talk about. Also, I have never worked in a company that had more
than 3,000 employees, and I feel most at home in small outfits under
50. I’m reasonably confident that what I talk about is somewhat useful
for companies from 3 to 3,000 people in the software industry. It
<em>may</em> be applicable elsewhere — larger companies, other industries —
but at any rate, I make no guarantees of any kind. Feel free to adopt
an entirely contrarian position. And, you should also know I am not a
scientist, so none of what I write is informed by rigorous empiricism.</p>
<p>So, are we cool with that? <strong>My opinion, my thoughts, my views — not
pronouncements of absolute truth.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:newsy">
<p>For context: it was at the top for like three hours on a
Saturday morning. So it might have landed there just because
enough people were simultaneously bored enough to give it a
read… <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:newsy" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:in-person-meeting">
<p>Meeting Hell might <em>also</em> apply to excessive
in-person meetings in a shared work space, such as an
office. However, I really don’t believe my industry will ever go
back to defaulting to office-based work, now that it has shown for
nearly two years that it <em>can</em> function, in principle, in a
default-distributed mode. Thus, I am using the word “meeting” as
synonymous with “video meeting” in this series, and I wouldn’t be
surprised if this eventually became the norm.</p>
<p>Think of this as
akin to the transition undergone by the word <em>call:</em> before
the advent of the telephone, a <em>call</em> was a visit you paid to
someone’s house. Then, if you metaphorically “visited” someone by
telephone, that was a <em>telephone call</em>. Now a <em>call</em> is always a
phone call, except when explicitly specified as a <em>house call.</em> <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:in-person-meeting" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>
