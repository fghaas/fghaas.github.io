  <div>
    <p>I have no experience with, and presently no plans for, running or
organizing a grassroots knowledge-sharing conference. But if I did run
one, and I could shape it exactly as I wanted, this might be what it
would look like. Please be advised that I have no idea what I am
talking about.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about Nonexisticon, the non-existent conference. Just to
benefit your reading flow, dear reader, I am using the indicative
rather than the subjunctive mood, in other words, I use phrases like
“Nonexisticon <em>is</em>” as opposed to “Nonexisticon <em>would be</em>”<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I
trust that you are not confused by this, as the name very clearly
implies that the conference does not exist.</p>
<h2>Unifying Theme</h2>
<p>Nonexisticon’s theme is freely shared knowledge work. <strong>Nonexisticon
brings together open-data researchers, open-source software and
hardware engineers and designers, Creative Commoners, documentarians,
writers, artists, educators.</strong> Basically, if you create something with
your mind and you make your creation freely available for anyone to
use, enhance, modify and build upon, you’re welcome at
Nonexisticon.</p>
<p>Nonexisticon is also a mutually supportive conference, where
corporate-funded or financially secure attendees can commit to
supporting less-privileged ones.</p>
<h2>Location and Reach</h2>
<p><strong>Nonexisticon is a regional conference.</strong> “Region” in this context
means an area from which the conference attendees can reasonably
travel to the conference location, using environmentally friendly
transportation modes (such as high-speed rail). Attendance from
outside the region is welcome, but for environmental reasons it is not
encouraged.</p>
<p>Nonexisticon is typically held on a university campus, or other
suitable facility, in a location well accessible by public
transportation. Cheap accommodation is typically available on-campus.</p>
<h2>Supporting Organization</h2>
<p>Nonexisticon is organized by the Nonexisticon Association, a
not-for-profit organization that allows only individual, not corporate
membership. The organization is staffed by volunteers, that is to say,
while it is authorized to reimburse members of the conference team for
expenses incurred and income lost as a direct result of conference
work, it does not pay salaries to its staff.</p>
<p>Nonexisticon registration includes membership in this organization,
with full voting rights, for a period of two years.</p>
<h2>Recurrence and Length</h2>
<p>Any regional Nonexisticon has its own recurrence schedule, but the
conference is never held in the same region more than <strong>once per
year.</strong></p>
<p>Each Nonexisticon has a general theme. Themes can be quite diverse and
are generally broadly defined, so as to attract individuals from many
disciplines and backgrounds (as long as they relate to the unifying
theme of freely shared knowledge work). Examples for conference themes
are “cancer research”, “the Python programming language”, “high-energy
physics”, or “the arts in education.”</p>
<h2>Conference Committee</h2>
<p>Nonexisticon is run by a Conference Committee, which is a <strong>group of 5
individuals headed by a Conference Director.</strong> The Conference
Committee serves for the run-up, duration, and wind-down of one
Nonexisticon, oversees the appointment of the succeeding Committee,
and acts as advisors to the incoming Committee.</p>
<p>Would-be Conference Committees prepare a bid for the next
Nonexisticon. Bids specify the conference location, dates, venue,
capacity, theme, proposed sponsorship opportunities, and budget. If a
bid is uncontested, the prior Conference Committee merely assesses the
bid for plausibility and compliance with formal criteria, and accepts
the bid (thereby also appointing the new Conference Committee). If
more than one bid exists, the outgoing Conference Committee organizes
an on-line vote among the Association membership, using a preferential
voting system. The winning bid then results in the appointment of the
new Conference Committee.</p>
<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>Nonexisticon is a <strong>single-track conference, with one presentation
slot length available: 30 minutes.</strong> Nonexisticon typically runs over
the course of <strong>three days,</strong> with talks scheduled between 09:00 (9am)
and 18:00 (6pm) local time.</p>
<p>This means that after deducting conference opening and closing
remarks, keynotes, and breaks, <strong>Nonexisticon has 38 talks</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> in
total.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A time is at the speaker’s discretion; forgoing Q&amp;A entirely is
acceptable.</p>
<p>All presentations are <strong>open for rating</strong> by attendees for a short
time period of 5 minutes prior to, and 15 minutes after scheduled
conclusion.</p>
<p>Presentations are <strong>recorded</strong> by a professional A/V team, and
publicly released under a permissive license.</p>
<h2>Presentation Proposals</h2>
<p>Nonexisticon uses an <strong>anonymized call for proposals (CFP),</strong>
conducted online, using an open-source conference platform. The
Conference Committee defines the format of the CFP proper, including
the questions posed at submitters. The Conference Committee reviews
all submitted proposals, anonymized, for formal compliance with the
CFP only.</p>
<p><strong>Nonexisticon attendance <em>requires</em> the submission of a presentation
proposal.</strong> Thus, conference registration and presentation submission
are one and the same process. The conference registration fee must be
paid in full at the time of registration/submission.</p>
<p>Nonexisticon limits proposals to one per speaker/attendee. All
presentations are solo; multi-presenter talks and panel discussions
are not permitted.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
<h2>Underprivileged Attendee Fund</h2>
<p><strong>Prospective attendees unable to accommodate the registration fee,
conference travel, or accommodation</strong> may apply, upon registration, to
the Underprivileged Attendee Fund.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> If accepted (per decision by the
Conference Committee), the speaker/attendee is invited to attend the
conference free of charge, and their submitted presentation is
included in proposal review.</p>
<p>The Underprivileged Attendee Fund is endowed by</p>
<ul>
<li>corporate conference sponsorship,</li>
<li>donations to the Nonexisticon Association,</li>
<li>profits carried over from prior conferences,</li>
<li>donations from regular speaker-attendees who voluntarily put up
  double the regular application fee upon their own
  registration/proposal submission.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review process and talk selection</h2>
<p><strong>Talks are selected by all attendees/speakers</strong> during a time-limited
selection period using a <a href="http://www.deborda.org/faq/voting-systems/what-is-a-modified-borda-count.html">modified Borda count
(MBC)</a>
ranking process, as pioneered by the scientific community <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.1943">for
allocating observation time on astronomical
telescopes</a>.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, every attendee is assigned a small, randomly selected
set of proposals (about 10, and excluding their own submission) to
review. They then rank these submissions not in an order of
subjectively “best” to “worst”, but from <em>most beneficial to the overall
attendee community</em> to <em>least beneficial to the overall attendee
community.</em> This results in an overall preliminary ranking of
submissions, which is then compared to each attendee’s individual
ranking. A high degree of agreement of an individual attendee’s
ranking with the overall preliminary tally results in additional
points for the attendee’s own proposal; the contrary, in subtracted
points. Ultimately, this produces a final, definitive ranking of all
received proposals.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The entire ranking process is automated using open-source software,
and both the preliminary and the final ranking result are publicized
to all attendees/submitters.</p>
<p>The submitters of the 48 top-ranked presentations (38 plus 10
backup/waitlist presentations) are refunded their registration fee
upon acceptance.</p>
<p>If an accepted speaker needs to withdraw their talk, the next-ranked
talk automatically moves up, and the speaker’s registration is
simultaneously canceled.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
<h2>Budget and Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Nonexisticon’s budget calls for a barebones conference (infrastructure
only, no catering, no childcare) to break even solely on
registration fees equivalent to two-thirds of the venue capacity. In
case of registrations being in excess of this threshold, Nonexisticon
funds childcare, refreshments, and catered lunch, in that order.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Nonexisticon is open to sponsoring. Sponsoring, however, does not buy
presentation slots, nor does it have any bearing on keynote
selection. Sponsors can choose to contribute to infrastructure,
catering, childcare, the Underprivileged Attendee Fund, and social
events. Of these, social events are the only category open
<em>exclusively</em> to sponsor funding; Nonexisticon does not spend
registration fee revenue on social events.</p>
<p>If registrations do not meet the two-thirds threshold, and the budget
shortfall cannot be compensated by sponsor contributions or profits
carried over from prior conferences, the conference is cancelled and
registration fees refunded.</p>
<h2>Keynotes</h2>
<p><strong>Nonexisticon has one keynote, which opens the conference.</strong> The
Conference Committee extends the keynote speaker invitation by
consensus.</p>
<p>The closing “keynote” is a reprise of the highest-rated presentation
in the conference.</p>
<h2>Conference run-up timeline</h2>
<p>Nonexisticon’s attendee-visible run-up cycle is 6 months.</p>
<p>Assuming a Nonexisticon is scheduled to run from May 15-17, the
following schedule applies:</p>

<h3>Disclaimer and acknowledgments</h3>
<p>I’d like to reiterate that I have no experience whatsoever in running
or putting on a conference, since the only time I’ve contributed to
them as something other than a mere speaker, I’ve sat on proposal
selection committees. So take all of what I wrote above with a
mountain of salt, and consider it nothing more than semi-elaborate
handwaving full of glaring omissions. But if you do want to give me
some feedback, even it is simply telling me <em>why</em> my ideas are nuts —
as opposed to just <em>that</em> they are — I’d be most grateful. Find me on
<a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi">Twitter</a> or

<p>That said, thanks to <a href="https://tom.eastman.nz/">Tom Eastman</a> for

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Dear grammar stickler, I am acutely aware that a phrase
including <em>would + infinitive</em> is not a <em>true</em> subjunctive
mood, but the use of a modal verb. Feel free to replace all such
instances with a true subjunctive in your head. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Don’t bother to check the talk arithmetic. It doesn’t matter
whether it’s really 36 talks or 41 or 42. I just picked 38 as a
reasonable, concrete number to work with. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Disallowing multiple submissions from one person, and
presentations with multiple speakers, is a necessary consequence
of the talk selection process. Allowing only one submission per
submitter also has the added benefit that prospective speakers can
focus on one single talk and give the proposal their very best
shot. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>Is there a better name for this? <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>If you find this summary insufficient to explain the process but
also don’t feel like plowing through the paper, here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/7c0CoXFApnM">a video
explanation</a>, plus <a href="https://youtu.be/bplncn4xC74">additional
information</a>. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:6">
<p>It is admittedly harsh to only be able to pull out of an
accepted talk by pulling out of the conference altogether. I
consider this a necessary evil to ensure that no
attendee/submitter submit their proposal without genuine intent to
present. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:7">
<p>Of these, I am most on the fence about childcare. Meaning it
would probably be a good idea to always budget for child-care
cost, even if that means a higher registration fee for everyone,
and thus a slightly elevated risk of conference cancellation. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text">↩</a></p>
