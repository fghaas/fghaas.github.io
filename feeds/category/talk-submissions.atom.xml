&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Contravictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
“elevator pitch”. Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contraviction is when a person firmly believes that two objectively
mutually exclusive standpoints are simultaneously true. Being
contravinced makes you extremely vulnerable to manipulation. Here’s
how to spot a contraviction, and what to do about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What format is this talk best suited for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk (~25-40 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audience Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the best target audience for this talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and
may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event. You should
make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as
possible. Remember, you’re selling both the organizers of the events
to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your
talk is the one they should see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Contraviction” is a term I use for when a person is firmly convinced
of two sides of an obvious contradiction. This may sound like it would
be an unusual and rare occasion, and yet, once you start looking, they
are all over the place. A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of &lt;strong&gt;Nazi ideology&lt;/strong&gt; in Germany in the 1920s and 30s was
  the notion that Jews are engaged in a &lt;em&gt;successful&lt;/em&gt; global conspiracy
  to subjugate all nations including the German nation, and that Jews
  were also, &lt;em&gt;simultaneously,&lt;/em&gt; socially, intellectually, economically,
  and morally inferior to Germans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of &lt;strong&gt;religious extremism&lt;/strong&gt; is the belief that God is
  all-forgiving and merciful, and also that as long as a portion of
  humanity (“infidels”) displeases God, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of humanity must suffer
  God’s wrath. We see this in contemporary Islamic extremism, but
  Catholicism in the 16th century did no better in the conquest of
  Latin America, nor did Western Christianity do much differently
  during the medieval crusades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of &lt;strong&gt;Trumpism&lt;/strong&gt; is the notion that the United States of
  America is the greatest nation on Earth and that there is no better
  nation nor will there ever be, but also that America has been ruined
  by “the liberals” and has slipped into inferiority, so that it is
  necessary to “make America great again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all these examples, both statements can logically be false, or one
of them &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; theoretically be true — but if one is true, the other
one &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be false. And yet, people (&lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of people!) hold or
held both of these statements to be true, simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But being contravinced puts people in a very vulnerable position: if
someone gets you to believe both sides of a contradiction, they can
&lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; argue &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to follow from either one side, or the
opposite. Which means they can convince you of anything. And that
never ends well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk defines contravictions, highlights examples (even devopsy
ones!) and provides suggestions on how to uncover and dismantle
them. Because contravictions have the potential to poison and destroy
discourse, and that’s a cultural issue we all need to deal with —
among friends, family, and coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is
where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why
you’re the best person to speak on this subject, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that the nature of this topic is sensitive and
emotional — yes I, an Austrian, will be talking about Nazi ideology,
in Israel, consider me terrified — I’ll need to submit this on the
condition that I’d only want to deliver this talk &lt;em&gt;in person.&lt;/em&gt; If that
does not permit itself on account of the Covid-19 situation or of
travel restrictions, and I would have to rely on a streamed talk and
have no way of reading the room or scanning the audience for body
language feedback (some more details on this topic
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/08/24/online-conferences-audience-feedback/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),
then I’d rather not give the talk at all, rather than stream it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this disqualifies the talk (or if you just consider it too
controversial to begin with), no hard feelings at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag your talk to make it easier for event organizers to be able to
find. Examples are “ruby, javascript, rails”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Review Review: comparing code review, testing, staging and
deployment across development collaboration platforms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
“elevator pitch”. Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub, GitLab, Gerrit — what should I choose? What’s the best review
process, the best CI/CD integration, the best deployment facility?
Which should I select for my startup, or consider migrating to? Which
supports good collaboration practices, which bad ones? This talk gives
the run-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What format is this talk best suited for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk (~25-40 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audience Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the best target audience for this talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and
may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event. You should

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DevOps, the process of collaborative review, testing, staging, and
deployment to production constitutes a core element of the work we
do. And we generally strive to make this process as effective,
efficient, smooth, and transparent as possible. Achieving that partly
comes from the work culture we shape and inhabit, partly from our
selection of tools — and of course, work culture and work tools
permanently and closely influence each other. This goes for both the
tools that drive review, and the tools that drive CI/CD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pull Request&lt;/strong&gt; process in combination with &lt;strong&gt;GitHub
  Actions&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;GitLab Merge Request&lt;/strong&gt; process in combination with &lt;strong&gt;GitLab
  CI&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;Gerrit Review&lt;/strong&gt; process in combination with &lt;strong&gt;Zuul&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these is perfect, all of them have their advantages and
disadvantages under particular circumstances. Some are meant to be
used principally as a service, some are fine to self-host. Some are
adamant about enforcing specific deployment practices, some follow a
more relaxed approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a summary of the current state of affairs with all these
tools, and contains recommendations on what to use under which
circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is
where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why
you’re the best person to speak on this subject, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team and I have worked with all tools mentioned in a professional
capacity, and I believe I’ve got a very good understanding of the
relative merits of the systems presented. This does not include a
hard-and-fast recommendation for one particular tool or platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a talk that’s suitable for both in-person and on-line events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add depth! Stereoscopic imagery for everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will appear in the conference programme. Up to about 500
words. This field is rendered with the monospace font Hack with

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereoscopic imagery (photography and videography) is a fascinating
way to create 3-dimensional images of landscapes, unmoving and moving
objects, and of course, people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll cover the basics of stereoscopic imagery and
projection, discover how stereoscopic vision works, and how we can
trick our brains into perceiving depth from two flat images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with the principles of three-dimensional vision in humans:
how our eyes use the combination of focus and vergence to signal two
slightly different images of our surroundings to our brain, and how
our brain then processes these images to give us the perception of
depth. Then, we discuss the techniques available to play tricks on our
brains in which two slightly (but cleverly) distinct &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;-dimensional
images are presented to our eyes in such a way that our mind conjures
up depth where there objectively is none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques come in various forms, from very high tech (such as
virtual reality goggles) to very low tech (like mechanical
stereoscopic viewers), but some can deal without any projection
technology at all: this is called freeviewing, and for most people it
is a remarkably simple and low-cost way to enjoy stunning
three-dimensional imagery. We’ll cover the parallel-view and crossview
freeviewing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll then dive into the simple but highly effective steps of making
stereoscopic images, using run-of-the-mill cameras (even cell phones),
and some straightforward image processing in the GIMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we talk about some neat little tricks to make stereoscopic
videos, with minimal cost and investment. We’ll look at how we can
make 3D video with just a GoPro, or a simple drone camera — again
using a free software tool, namely the OpenShot video editor, for
processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will only be shown to organisers and reviewers. You should
provide any details about your proposal that you don’t want to be
public here. This field is rendered with the monospace font Hack
with whitespace preserved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk does not cover a specific software project; the “Project
URL” below is simply a Flickr album containing a set of stereoscopic
images created with the technique I am describing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that LCA is an online event this year would suit this talk
particularly well: when I get to the point of explaining freeviewing
to attendees, I would expect novices to have some difficulty with
&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the freeviewing techniques, and some, with both. The latter
would have the option of simply backing up the stream and re-watching
the instructions and the test images provided, which is an option that
would not exist in a live talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility note: Regretfully, this talk will have limited
accessibility for people with vision deficiencies. Specifically, the
3D effects presented will be inaccessible to people with complete loss
of vision in one eye (or both), nystagmus, or strabismus. People with
these conditions will still be able to learn from the techniques
presented in the talk, but will likely be unable to perceive the
demonstrated 3D effects themselves. People with intraocular lens (IOL)
implants might also have difficulty following some of the examples in
the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional skill-building is challenging, particularly when the
skill to acquire is about distributed, scalable platform
technology. In this talk, I cover an open-source skill-building
platform that is 100% Python: built on Open edX and heavily involving
Django, Ansible, and OpenStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information technology industry is currently dealing with an
interesting challenge in professional skill-building: almost every new
technology developed in recent years has been complex, distributed,
and built for scale: Kubernetes, Ceph, and OpenStack can serve as just
a few representative examples. Loose coupling, asynchronicity, and
elasticity are just some of the qualities frequently found in such
systems that were entirely absent in many of the systems we built only
a few years ago. As a result, people comfortable with building and
operating these complex systems are hardly found in abundance, and
organisations frequently struggle to adopt these technologies as a
direct result of this scarcity: we are dealing with a skills gap, not
a technology gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we need novel ways to educate professionals on these
technologies. We must provide professional learners with complex,
distributed systems to use as realistic learning environments, and we
must enable them to learn from anywhere, at any time, and on their own
pace. One excellent way of doing this is to use the capabilities of
the Open edX platform to integrate a learning management system with
hands-on, on-demand lab environments that can be just as complex, and
just as distributed, as production systems. This allows anyone
interested to develop a professional skill set on novel technology at
minimal cost, and without the need for costly hardware platforms for
evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will give a rapid technical introduction to the core
components of this free and open source (AGPL 3/ASL 2) all-Python
platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edx-platform, the core learning management system (LMS) and content
  management system (CMS), built on Django;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edx-configuration, the automated deployment facility to roll out the
  Open edX platform, built on Ansible;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and finally, the Open edX XBlock extension system and its
  integration with OpenStack, also itself an all-Python cloud
  platform, in order to provide on-demand lab environments from both
  private and public cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will only be shown to organisers and reviewers. You should

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come from a background in technical consulting and instructor-driven
professional education, and together with my team have been building
and deploying Open edX based platforms as described in the talk
since 2015. I believe I have a good understanding on why
instructor-driven training, while desirable, is not accessible to
everyone in need of keeping abreast with technology development, and
that a self-paced, learn-from-anywhere alternative is needed. I am
extremely grateful for the fact that we have an very well-suited
platform for that purpose, and since it has a completely open-source,
Python codebase, it might be of interest to LCA attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done a talk on a similar topic at the LCA 2018 Education
miniconf (video link included below). In the 2018 talk, I focused
primarily on the educational aspects of self-paced, on-line
training. This time, and I think more appropriately for the main
conference track, I would like to dive into the nuts and bolts of the
platform that drives this. As such, the talk should still be appealing
to people engaged in professional education (be it as learners,
tutors, or instructional designers), but will also be insightful to
Python and OpenStack developers, and heavy Ansible users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Don’t Think This Means What You Think It Means: Red Herrings in
OpenStack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
“elevator pitch”. Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStack’s complexity comes with operational challenges. And in
situations where OpenStack misbehaves, it is frequently non-trivial to
find the actual cause of an issue. This talk includes several examples
of red herrings in OpenStack, and suggestions for spotting
and avoiding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk (&amp;gt;30-45 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audience Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should make the description of your talk as compelling and
exciting as possible. Remember, you’re selling both the organizers
of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince
attendees your talk is the one they should see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with OpenStack, you deal with an environment that is
inherently complex. As with all complex environments, things sometimes
go wrong or behave unexpectedly. And when &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; happens, your
immediate goal is to locate, pinpoint, and then troubleshoot the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, sometimes, you go down the dead-wrong path, and end up
chasing a red herring for some time, before you find the real
problem. This talk contains examples of such red herrings, enabling
you to recognize and avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is both for those who &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; an OpenStack cloud, and those
who &lt;em&gt;consume&lt;/em&gt; its functionality as a service. It talks about both red
herrings in OpenStack operations, and red herrings in operating
applications &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;  OpenStack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field supports Markdown. Notes will only be seen by reviewers
during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such
as technical requirements, why you’re the best person to speak on
this subject, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on OpenStack since 2012, have consulted on lots of
private and public cloud deployments using OpenStack, and I work for
the operator of a multi-region global OpenStack Cloud. “I’ve seen
things you people wouldn’t believe. Attack ships on fire off the
shoulder of Orion…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to what &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; have seen, others have seen other things,
which is why I am crowdsourcing the content of this talk. That being
so, the talk proposal &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/talk-submissions/oidn-2019-red-herrings/"&gt;is
public&lt;/a&gt;,
and I am asking people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/1126030330937380864"&gt;on
Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to
send me their stories, which I will add to and mix with my own, with
due attribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give one example of what I would like to cover, see &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/hints-and-kinks/1000-routers-per-tenant-think-again/"&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;
on my web site, which talks about how you can run into what looks like
a quota issue in Neutron, but whose cause is in fact buried deep in
&lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5798"&gt;RFC 5798&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One For All: Using Terraform to manage OpenStack and Kubernetes
resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
“elevator pitch”. Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hands-on introduction to Terraform in an OpenStack and Kubernetes
context. Get the basics (of Terraform), then spin up a Kubernetes
cluster in an OpenStack public cloud (with Terraform), and manage
resources on it (with Terraform).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workshop (&amp;gt;60 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in deployment automation for arbitrarily complex
containerized microservice applications, this is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, you will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get to know the basics of &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/"&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; and
  &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/"&gt;Terraform
  configurations&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spin up a Kubernetes cluster with Terraform, using the &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/"&gt;OpenStack
  provider&lt;/a&gt; and
  interfacing with &lt;a href="https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/latest/user/"&gt;OpenStack
  Magnum&lt;/a&gt; in a public
  cloud,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start managing Kubernetes resources from Terraform, using the
  &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/"&gt;Kubernetes
  provider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll walk away with a solid understanding of Terraform’s
capabilities, enabling you to make an informed decision of whether
Terraform is a suitable deployment automation facility for your
organization’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior Terraform knowledge is not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no technical requirements other than internet connectivity,
and a web browser (preferably on a laptop, though a reasonably-sized

&lt;a href="https://linux.conf.au/"&gt;linux.conf.au&lt;/a&gt; 2019. The conference uses a

&lt;p&gt;This talk was accepted as a &lt;em&gt;standby talk,&lt;/em&gt; meaning it was slated to
fill the gap if any other talk had to be cancelled on short notice. I
did prepare the full talk, though it did not end up presenting it at
the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also submitted the talk to &lt;a href="https://2019.djangocon.eu"&gt;DjangoCon Europe

&lt;p&gt;This is a personal story. It does not claim to be rooted in
statistical analysis or scientific rigour, and the evidence presented
is anecdotal. But it might be insightful to anyone joining, leaving,
or interacting with a remote team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2017, I ran a company that had no office. Everyone worked
from home, and apart from an annual one-week face to face meeting, all
our communications were remote. In 2017, I sold my company and
integrated my team into a company that had previously been working
exclusively out of a single office. As one would expect, the
integration was not without friction (they never are), but what
emerged from the experience was a better understanding of the
challenges that come with a mixed office/remote work environment, and
some rules to address them. In this talk, I’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical misconceptions that remoties have about office-workers, and
  vice versa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the right tools for the right type of communications:
  interactive chat, email, wiki, issue trackers, Kanban boards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timezones, and communications around scheduling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

  everyone is on the same page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow-up and follow-through, and how to make sure neither you, nor
  your team, nor your boss loses sight of what needs doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writing for learners: best practices for creating, developing, and
maintaining self-paced learning resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information here is better. Submitting a single paragraph won’t
give us much to go on, but please no walls of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation talks about a special kind of tech writing: creating
and maintaining self-paced technical training content. This
encompasses both prose for theoretical background information, and
instructions for hands-on labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll go over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;special challenges (and advantages!) of self-directed over
  instructor-driven training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;video content, and why we don’t do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our rules for structuring theoretical content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our approach for interactive lab instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is rooted in 4 years’ experience in writing courseware used for
learning complex technical topics (like OpenStack, Kubernetes, Ceph,
and others) on an Open edX platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll find the concepts discussed in this talk useful if you write
courseware (of course), but I’d say they equally apply whenever you
find yourself writing any content that is instructive, rather than
descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who and why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is this talk for? What background knowledge or experience do you
expect the audience to have? What is the take away from the talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for anyone who, in a technical context, uses
imperatives. I’ve been at least a part-time tech writer for the better
part of the last 10 years, but I’ve written software documentation for
only 4 of those – the majority of the remainder I’ve written
courseware content instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing prose training content and lab instructions comes with its own
unique challenges and its own (explicit or implicit) style
guide. Since as courseware authors we communicate with our learners
exclusively in writing, I believe I have good practices to share with
other documentarians who might occasionally find themselves in the
situation of writing lab instructions and test scenario descriptions,
and I think there are equally many things that can learn from other
talks and speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other information that might be interesting for us to know about
you? Give a lightning talk last year, speak at a WTD meetup, or
anything else interesting? Add it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never spoken at any Write The Docs conference, though I have done
talks and workshops at multiple instances of linux.conf.au, LinuxCon
(now Open Source Summit), OpenStack Summit (now Open Infrastructure
Summit), the Open edX Conference, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team and I maintain City Cloud Academy (academy.citycloud.com),
which runs on Open edX.&lt;/p&gt;
