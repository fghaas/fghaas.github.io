Here are a few related things I also learned about in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Surely you’ve seen a question similar to the following in a survey or
request for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you’ll recommend X to a colleague or friend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this question, X is either a product or service, or a brand, or
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of a company’s products or services. Answers are given on a
scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “not at all likely” and 10 being
“extremely likely”. It is frequently the last question in a survey,
or even the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this question is so frequent is that it drives a metric
that is popular with marketingfolk and management: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score"&gt;net promoter
score&lt;/a&gt;, or NPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work out the NPS, what you do is deduct the percentage of
“detractors” of your product from that of the “promoters”. If the net
result is above zero, per the lore, you are generally doing well. If
you hit above 30, your product or service or brand or company is
allegedly performing excellently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s a promoter? What’s a detractor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what defines your promoters and detractors, according to the NPS
metric? Clearly we’ll have to slot the possible responses into
categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s where you’ll notice something peculiar about the scale. It
consists of discrete values going from 0 to 10 inclusive, not from 0
to 9 or 1 to 10. That means it’s an 11-point scale. What do we notice
about the number 11?  Exactly, it’s prime. It’s thus impossible to
sort the scale items into evenly sized categories, no matter how many
or few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But okay, let’s say it’s not a law that the categories need to be
evenly sized. So you might think that answering anything from 0 to 3
makes someone a “detractor”, and anything between 7 and 10 a
“promoter”, with the middle ground (4 to 6) being somewhat neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what NPS uses. The actual NPS scale looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 to 6: detractor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 to 8: “passive”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 to 10: promoter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, recall that NPS ignores the “passive” respondents altogether, and
only looks at the percentage of “promoters” minus that of
“detractors”. If a majority of respondents answer 7 or 8 (intuitively
a solidly positive score, if you ask me), those do not factor into the
result at all. Only being inclined to &lt;em&gt;rather enthusiasically&lt;/em&gt;
recommend a product or service makes you a promoter. And answering 6,
clearly north of the scale’s middle mark, makes you a detractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this oddly warped scale in combination with ignoring part
of the sample altogether makes the deduction of one percentage from
another rather agony-inducing for any secondary school maths
teacher. That’s eminently not how these things work; on its face it’s
one of those results that Wolfgang Pauli &lt;a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli"&gt;would have
called&lt;/a&gt; “not only not
right, but not even wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Would you recommend a rental car company to someone who doesn’t need a rental car?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in addition to a warped scale and off-label use of percentages,
NPS also uses an inherently biased premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I rent a car from a fictitious company we’ll call My Local
Public Transit Sucks, or MyLoPTS. And after I return my vehicle, I am
asked how likely I am to recommend renting a car from MyLoPTS to “a
friend,” which I would presume to mean any randomly selected one of my
friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I would not recommend &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; rental car company to someone I know
to not be in need of a rental car. And I would assume that a &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt;
of 10% of my friends, acquaintances, and colleagues are in need of a
rental car at any one time (considering that &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; locally available
public transport very much does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; suck, so the demand for rental
cars is quite low). So even if I was &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; to recommend MyLoPTS to
anyone &lt;em&gt;needing&lt;/em&gt; a rental car, the correct answer for the question as
asked — the likelihood of recommending MyLoPTS to &lt;em&gt;a friend,&lt;/em&gt;
regardless of circumstances — on a scale of 1 to 10 would be 1. My
answer to the question as stated thus has little to no relation to how
happy I am with MyLoPTS’ service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it’s a misguided question with a warped scale that makes implicit
assumptions and then does creative maths with the result. Why do so
many people believe that this makes any sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greetings from Harvard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, apparently, is in &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow"&gt;a single article in the Harvard
Business
Review&lt;/a&gt;. That
article will be old enough to drink in two years’ time in its USian
habitat, so whether its 2003 findings are still valid in 2022 is
debatable. But let’s assume for the time being that they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of the scale in question, here’s a quote from that
article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We] settled on a scale where ten means “extremely likely” to
recommend, five means neutral, and zero means “not at all likely.”
When we examined customer referral and repurchase behaviors along
this scale, we found three logical clusters. “Promoters,” the
customers with the highest rates of repurchase and referral, gave
ratings of nine or ten to the question. The “passively satisfied”
logged a seven or an eight, and “detractors” scored from zero to
six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Frederick F. Reichheld, &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow"&gt;The One Number You Need to
Grow&lt;/a&gt;,
Harvard Business Review (2003)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this confirms that the scale itself isn’t meant to be warped by
default. Anything under 5 means unlikely to recommend, 5 is neutral,
and anything above 5 is likely to recommend. (Since the respondents
would presumably be required to select discrete values, that fact
still warps the scale and places the “neutral” value off-centre —
but let’s assume the creators of the scale did think of it as a
continuum, which does not have this problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being baked into the scale from the get-go, the
categorization into “promoters” comes from an actual correlation of
responses to repurchase and referral behavior.  Or at least the
article claims so — the research data it’s based on does not appear
to be publicly available. We can only assume that similar correlations
with actual customer behavior were drawn for the “passively satisfied”
and “detractor” categories, though I am not quite sure how they would
have identified the former, separating them from promoters. I suppose
a “passively satisfied” person could perhaps have been one that did
come back to make another purchase, but never made a referral? It
would be interesting to see how they tracked that in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the HBR article then asserts that NPS was a predictor of
company growth when comparing to its competition: in other words, that
companies with a higher NPS than their competitors also experienced
higher revenue growth than them — across multiple industries (the
article specifically mentions airlines, ISPs, and rental car
companies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “would recommend” question wasn’t the best predictor of growth
in every case. In a few situations, it was simply irrelevant. In
database software or computer systems, for instance, senior
executives select vendors, and top managers typically didn’t appear
on the public e-mail lists we used to sample customers. Asking users
of the system whether they would recommend the system to a friend or
colleague seemed a little abstract, as they had no choice in the
matter. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, “would recommend” also didn’t
predict relative growth in industries dominated by monopolies and
near monopolies, where consumers have little choice. For example, in
the local telephone and cable TV businesses, population growth and
economic expansion in the region determine growth rates, not how
well customers are treated by their suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Frederick F. Reichheld, &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow"&gt;The One Number You Need to
Grow&lt;/a&gt;,
Harvard Business Review (2003)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds quite reasonable. Obviously, recommending a product to a
friend or colleague doesn’t help the company selling it, if the friend
or colleague has no say in the purchase decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultural bias, and Goodhart et al.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s another thing that the article &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; say, apparently
because it’s obviously implied: all companies covered in the research,
and presumably the vast majority of the customers surveyed, were from
the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://measuringu.com/scales-cultural-effects/"&gt;It’s rather well
understood&lt;/a&gt; that
scales are read differently by people from different cultures. So
while the correlation of a certain response score with a certain
behaviour is likely to work fine when you’re surveying U.S. customers
of U.S. companies, it’s likely to fall apart when you’re trying to
make similar predictions from answers from non-U.S. respondents, or
to compare responses internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note further that the article describes NPS as a &lt;em&gt;predictor&lt;/em&gt; of
growth, meaning &lt;em&gt;the underlying conditions&lt;/em&gt; that cause a company to
have a high NPS &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; give it a competitive advantage and thus
facilitate growth. Trying to tweak the measure itself — for example,
by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/larsmb/status/1579137943750385665"&gt;coaching
people&lt;/a&gt; to
respond 9 or 10 when they would intuitively select 7 or 8 — is a
great example of collapsing a statistical regularity by placing
pressure on it for control purposes, i.e. &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/11/14/meaningless-metrics-treacherous-targets/"&gt;Goodhart’s
Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, NPS is subject to &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/11/14/meaningless-metrics-treacherous-targets/"&gt;Campbell’s
Law&lt;/a&gt; as much as
any other metric. When a score becomes the goal of a process, it both
loses its value as an indicator, and distorts the process itself in
undesirable ways. You could argue that this effect of NPS is a
regrettable, but natural aftereffect of its enduring popularity over
nearly 20 years — but no, &lt;em&gt;it’s right there in the same HBR
article:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branch scores were not improving quickly enough, and a big gap
continued to separate the worst- and best-performing regions. […]
So the management team decided that field managers would not be
eligible for promotion unless their branch or group of branches
matched or exceeded the company’s average scores. That’s a pretty
radical idea when you think about it: giving customers, in effect,
veto power over managerial pay raises and promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Frederick F. Reichheld, &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow"&gt;The One Number You Need to
Grow&lt;/a&gt;,
Harvard Business Review (2003)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Radical” strikes me as a rather charitable assessment for what
Goodhart and Campbell (and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Strathern"&gt;Marilyn
Strathern&lt;/a&gt;) would
call completely messing up the measure, by making it a career-defining
target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPS strikes me as Not Particularly Sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

today’s headlines to read, you would probably have dismissed me as a
lunatic. And you’d probably say the same to someone who dropped in on
you today and read you the headlines from six months out. And if
conversely you tried to sit down tonight and write the headlines for
March 29, 2023, you’ll probably notice on the day that your predictions
were nowhere near actual events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have no idea what the world, or even your life, will look like
just six months from now. Make it five years or ten, and you won’t have
the faintest shimmer of a clue. There is no certainty about your
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are three approaches to deal with this kind of uncertainty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatalism. The idea that whatever happens will happen, you have no
   control over it, and therefore any attempt to wield any influence
   over your own life is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control. The idea that you can achieve certainty in your life by
   planning everything and leaving nothing to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity. The idea that, although some events in your life (and
   the world) are beyond your influence, you will have the ideas
   needed to make the best of the twists and turns, good and bad, that
   life throws at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing these, I’d maintain that fatalism is a terrible strategy
for life, and that far superior to sticking to the illusion of control
is an approach favouring creativity — “the process of having original
ideas that have value,” according to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_(educationalist)"&gt;Sir Ken
Robinson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, almost exactly the same considerations apply to the medium-term
future of a corporation. Nobody really knows what the future
holds. There is no certainty. The market can go either way, interest
rates can explode shattering your financing, you might close on an
unexpected opportunity that sends your business flying. In principle,
corporations could make the same considerations that apply to people,
and strive to foster creativity left, right, and centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am routinely dismayed, though, by the fact that the approach heavily
favoured in management is one of control, to absurd ends. I think it’s
obviously ludicrous to expect an engineering manager to “plan” what
their team will be working on 5 quarters from now, or a sales person
to “project” product sales next July. There are close to a million
things that could influence either outcome, and the person would have
to do the work equivalent to that of meteorologist predicting maritime
weather patterns for container ships, weeks and months out. Almost
nobody in business has the data, the time, the staff, and the budget
to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So managers turn to metrics and KPIs and OKRs and whatever the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym"&gt;TLA&lt;/a&gt; du jour may
be, in a frantic quest to achieve some degree of certainty — a process
which, &lt;a href="https://www.morebeyond.co.za/how-organisational-ocd-is-stamping-out-innovation/"&gt;as others have pointed
out&lt;/a&gt;,
suffocates the creativity that’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needed to address a
constantly changing environment. The idea is that if you collect all
the metrics and do all the statistics and measure everything (in other
words, if you follow some “process” perfectly), you’ll succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is so obviously non-sensical that the question becomes, &lt;em&gt;why the
hell does anyone think that this works?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have a hypothesis on why that is so. I attribute it to an
institution that practically every manager has gone through, indeed,
one that practically &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; has gone through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That institution is school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about yours, but I can say one thing about my own school
education: &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my schooling can be summarized in just a few
sentences. Specifically, here’s what school taught me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is a set of rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply these rules, and you will succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the rules &lt;em&gt;perfectly,&lt;/em&gt; and you will excel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That applied no matter the subject. It was as true for maths as it was
for foreign language education, and for writing essays in history
class. Here’s how it’s done; do it this way and you’ll succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I was good at applying rules. I succeeded in creative
writing even when my writing wasn’t at all creative: I could spell, I
had good grammar, my writing had the expected structure, I understood
punctuation. As long as my writing was error-free, I made A’s (or
rather, 1’s, in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_systems_by_country#Austria"&gt;the school system I
inhabited&lt;/a&gt;). My
schoolmates might have written far better stories, but if in a couple
of pages they had three grammar errors and a few misplaced commas and
a couple of spelling glitches, they’d make C’s (3’s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there’s nothing wrong with giving children a set of rules for
solving a problem, and then rewarding them for applying those rules
correctly.  The problem is with the idea that applying the rules
&lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; is where excellence lies. That the difference between
doing something well, and doing something &lt;em&gt;exceptionally&lt;/em&gt; well, is
simply in the more perfect application of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That couldn’t be farther from the truth. What distinguishes good
results from excellent ones is either that the excellent ones follow
the rules very well &lt;em&gt;and then add&lt;/em&gt; a personal creative touch, or that
they deliberately bend or reject conventions and are great
nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse. The people that school rewards the most — the ones it
considers the overachievers, the cream of the crop — are the ones who
can most perfectly follow the rules &lt;em&gt;everywhere.&lt;/em&gt; We call them
straight-A students. I was one of them. There is absolutely no way
that any one child could have straight A’s, if in school report cards
we applied an understanding of excellence that included
creativity. You cannot possibly be equally and exceptionally creative
in maths, science, languages, history, and all the other subjects you
take. &lt;em&gt;Straight&lt;/em&gt; A’s is what you get solely from industrious
compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, in business, we are stuck between a rock and a hard
place. There is a whole generation of people under 35 who have gone
through this kind of schooling, but are increasingly disillusioned by
it — having understood that all their rules-compliance in school and
at university is not a guarantee for economic prosperity or even
financial security, and further that they can scarcely expect loyalty
from their company if the going gets rough, even if they follow &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;
the rules like a straight-A student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those same people are being managed by upper-level managers in
their late 40s and 50s who not only &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; achieved some degree of
financial stability, but who do believe that it was their education
that prepared them for it — and that as long as they continue to
meticulously apply a set of rules, everything will be fine and they
get to expect a promotion. And when given a new rule book — say,
some new management fad imposed by a person of authority, akin to
their erstwhile teacher — all they need to do is apply &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; rules
well, and it all will work for them, too. And the more industrious
compliance they apply to the rules in the book, the more likely it is
that results will not only be good, but excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that rulebook includes collecting metrics everywhere and doing
misguided statistics on them, it will result in an inordinate amount
of busywork that kills the creativity that organizations &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
need to succeed. And likely drive away the people that could
contribute exactly that kind of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, this problem will rectify itself by those managers
retiring. But in the interim, maybe a few of us could ditch our school
approach to work and collaboration, and engage our brains to produce
the original ideas that we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="Work"></category><category term="Communications"></category></entry><entry><title>Something interesting happened at work the other week...</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2022/07/16/something-interesting/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2022-07-16:/blog/2022/07/16/something-interesting/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My company&amp;rsquo;s CEO recently put out a well-written email update instead of calling an all-hands meeting. It was excellent.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am sure that many of you have been summoned to your fair share of
quarterly, end-of-half-year, or end-of-year updates which were held by
way of a company meeting. You probably didn’t like them too much,
maybe even dreaded the thought of 45 minutes (or longer! 😱) of Death
By PowerPoint. But perhaps you didn’t mind turning up because hey, at
least it was free coffee and donuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic rolled around, many organizations turned that
quarterly all-hands summons into a quarterly all-hands &lt;em&gt;virtual&lt;/em&gt;
summons, in the shape of a video call. Now you had to supply your own
self-funded donuts, and probably didn’t like the idea of staring into
a camera for 45 minutes straight (or longer! 😖🔨). Worse still, I
hear that some of you might be have been subjected to virtual
&lt;em&gt;pre-recorded&lt;/em&gt; events, where you could watch an executive pontificate
from a script, with no interactivity whatsoever. Something, I imagine,
that is approximately as engaging as watching a wannabe investment
advisor on a YouTube channel with 6 subscribers, 4 of them relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, our CEO Jim (who, to his credit, previously ran these
events in a reasonably engaging fashion) did something different. At
the end of our second quarter, and a few days before going on annual
leave, he sat down and wrote an email. As in, he actually &lt;em&gt;sat down&lt;/em&gt;
and wrote an email. It had structure, it had a format, it had clear
messaging, it was to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was in the message?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m obviously not going to go into the detailed content of the
email, but here’s what stood out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message started with an intro that clearly settled the reader’s
  expectations: this is what I’m writing about; this is what you’ll be
  reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It clearly delineated that some of the items discussed were going to
  be somewhat negative (as in, worthy of improvement); many others
  were positive. It also clearly established that the negatives were
  coming first, and the positives thereafter.&lt;sup id="fnref:negatives-first"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:negatives-first"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used paragraphs, which were clearly separated by topic. As you
  read, you knew exactly where one thought concluded and the next one
  started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It conveyed an obviously personal viewpoint: Jim was giving his own
  perspective on things, rather than writing like a detached
  omniscient narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very evident that Jim hadn’t just bashed out the message and
  sent it off in a hurry, but that some careful re-reading and editing
  went into it. I have no idea if he did this by himself or asked
  someone else to go over it with him, but &lt;em&gt;that does not matter:&lt;/em&gt;
  what matters is that he edited, not whether he was his own
  editor.&lt;sup id="fnref:editor"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:editor"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What else is good about this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, the whole thing was a remarkable exercise in
efficiency. Jim put his thoughts into &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; 1,500
words.&lt;sup id="fnref:precision"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:precision"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As I’ve &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/27/this-meeting-should-have-been-an-email/"&gt;pointed out
elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;,
information you can express in 1,500 concisely written words is at the
top end of what you can convey in a 60-minute verbal meeting — but
when put in writing, it takes a fluent English speaker only about
6 minutes to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this compare to the conventional meeting-based approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had Jim prepared slides and a speech for an all-hands meeting, it
  would have taken him at least two hours, plus the hour of conducting
  the meeting. He probably spent the same total of three hours writing
  out, rereading, and editing his message. So the total effort &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt;
  had to spend on his email was about the same he would have needed to
  spend on the preparation and the conduct of a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone else, that is the other 98% of the company, reading the
  email took &lt;strong&gt;one-tenth&lt;/strong&gt; of the time that participating in a meeting
  conveying the same information would have taken. Jim gave back 90%
  of the productivity that would have been spent in a meeting, to 98%
  of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Makes sense, doesn’t it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes it eminently does. So, next time you consider summoning your whole
company to an all-hands meeting or video call, try to be a little more
like Jim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:negatives-first"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent move on two counts: first,
readers naturally perceive what comes last as being emphasised. By
getting the negatives out of the way first, the positives stick in
people’s minds more strongly. Second, it establishes that once you
get to the positives, there is no further downer coming to
sucker-punch you. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:negatives-first" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:editor"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trusted editor is a gift from god (if you believe in such
things). I can highly recommend asking someone you enjoy working
with to lend you an extra pair of eyes to go over what you
write. I was mutual editors with
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elenalindq"&gt;Elena Lindqvist&lt;/a&gt; for two years;
it was glorious. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:editor" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:precision"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am told this exact round-number precision was
coincidence. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:precision" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

ongoing. A week without posting articles on social media, while asking
people to subscribe my RSS feed, has yielded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practically zero engagement on Twitter (except for &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2022/05/10/drizzle/"&gt;the article on
  Drizzle&lt;/a&gt; article, which was reviewed by other
  people and then shared by my reviewers),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;very much non-zero engagement on Mastodon (where some of my
  followers have apparently been subscribers to my RSS feed for quite
  a while).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t surprise me much: evidently, the habit of subscribing to
feed sources via RSS comes more naturally to citizens of the
Fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice upside of the experiment is that &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; have been enjoying
content written by others more. My aggregation of about 20-or-so
feeds, followed via
&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tughi.aggregator"&gt;Aggregator&lt;/a&gt;,
gives me about 1 to two notifications new post per day, and most of
those I find truly enjoyable and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now progress to phase II in my experiment which is to throw new
posts out via RSS and Mastodon, but not on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Drizzle: the most influential software project you’ve (probably) never heard of</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2022/05/10/drizzle/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-10T17:15:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-05-11T16:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2022-05-10:/blog/2022/05/10/drizzle/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Drizzle aimed to rewrite the MySQL database server. It instead rewrote collaborative software development.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drizzle&lt;/strong&gt; was an open-source project&lt;sup id="fnref:disclaimer"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:disclaimer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that, for all
intents and purposes, died in 2016. Its project web site is now
defunct, and the most recent snapshot from the Wayback Machine is
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902091713/http://www.drizzle.org/"&gt;that of September 2,
2016&lt;/a&gt;.
In July of that year, Stewart Smith (one of the project’s core team)
&lt;a href="(https://www.mail-archive.com/drizzle-discuss@lists.launchpad.net/msg09228.html)."&gt;announced on the project mailing
list&lt;/a&gt;
that neither he nor any other core team members had time to dedicate
to Drizzle anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to that, the project had been mostly dormant since 2012&lt;sup id="fnref:2013"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2013"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
having been founded in 2008. So it was properly “active” for just 4
years, and then in limbo for 4 more before finally wrapping
up. Chances are, you’ve probably never run a Drizzle database server
in production, and quite possibly never spun one up for any purpose
either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, if you’re an open source software developer, you’re probably
using something, every single day, that came out of Drizzle. And that
something isn’t even software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drizzle’s history, a very brief summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drizzle started as an attempt to refactor MySQL, and was originally
driven by Brian Aker, together with a small team of engineers at Sun
(which had then-recently acquired MySQL), in the first half of 2008. A
skunk works project that flew under the radar — to put it charitably —
at Sun, Drizzle was publicly announced at O’Reilly OSCON of that year.
There are a couple of videos floating around from that event (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9DuJFUnxg7k"&gt;from
the keynotes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2tO7_Ozr-9U"&gt;from a booth
presentation&lt;/a&gt;) that are both… well, go
and see for yourself. The aforementioned Stewart Smith did a very
entertaining talk at linux.conf.au some five years later that covers
those events, which you can watch from &lt;a href="https://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2014/Wednesday/28-Past_Present_and_future_of_MySQL_and_variants_-_Stewart_Smith.mp4"&gt;the official Linux Australia
mirror&lt;/a&gt;,
or from a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uv9vcb4SdA"&gt;YouTube
upload&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also an interesting old blog post from MySQL co-founder Monty
Widenius, &lt;a href="https://monty-says.blogspot.com/2008/07/what-if.html"&gt;written in late July of
2008&lt;/a&gt;, which
outlines the state of affairs at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in 2010 Oracle acquired Sun (and with it, the MySQL
database) — and Oracle was presumably less than keen on having an
&lt;em&gt;in-house&lt;/em&gt; fork of the database technology it had just acquired. Thus,
the Drizzle engineers found a new home at Rackspace, with the goal of
getting Drizzle to a production-ready release. That &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt;
happened, and the Drizzle package even got into Debian, but after &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/7.1"&gt;the
Drizzle 7.1 release in 2012&lt;/a&gt;,
adoption did not exactly skyrocket. Development on Drizzle stagnated
and eventually petered out.  The 7.2 release branch &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/7.2"&gt;never made it out
of the alpha stage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, to the best of my knowledge, you can’t install a Drizzle
package on any contemporary operating system. There is &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/search?q=drizzle"&gt;no official
Drizzle container image on Docker
Hub&lt;/a&gt;, no DBaaS offering based
on Drizzle, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Drizzle left a very important legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did Drizzle do differently?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, it was already common for open source software to live in
public version-controlled repositories. But far from all of them used
&lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, like the vast majority do today: some
used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;, some
used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;, and the
&lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/"&gt;Launchpad&lt;/a&gt; platform (which Drizzle lived on)
used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bazaar"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of them did have one thing in common, which is how changes
landed in the tree. You had a small group of “core committers”, who
had write access to the “official” code repository. They could (and
would) push changes to the codebase on their own volition and
authority. In smaller projects, the core committers “group” might be
just one person.  If someone &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the core committers group
wanted to make a contribution, they had to convince a core committer
to merge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes (though quite rarely at the time), projects had some form of
scripted unit testing — typically implemented with the then-popular
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_(software)"&gt;Hudson&lt;/a&gt; server,
which was subsequently forked to become
&lt;a href="https://www.jenkins.io/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;.  But such unit tests would be seen
as merely advisory: breaking unit tests didn’t necessarily mean that a
patch couldn’t land, &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; if the patch originated with a
core committer. Unit tests would also not necessarily run
automatically when a patch was submitted, they might instead run only
if specifically kicked off by a core committer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drizzle team, as Brian put it in a talk I recall attending (though
not exactly when and where), “took commit rights away from everybody.”
That meant that &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt; could push changes directly to a central
repository, and &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; had to flow through CI tests. The process
generally went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You submitted a patch to Drizzle, implementing a new feature.
  Immediately after your submission, an automated process (in Hudson,
  later Jenkins) would automatically run its complete suite of unit
  tests against the current code base, with your patch applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your patch would perhaps break an existing regression test. You
  would immediately be notified of the failure, giving you a chance to
  fix the problem that your change introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You submitted a new version of the patch, which would now pass the
  test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans would now review your patch. They would no longer have to
  worry that your patch broke anything pre-existing (a common question
  in patch reviews in many contemporary projects), and could instead
  focus on the merit of your feature addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your reviewers determined that your new feature should come with
  &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; tests (and they usually should), they would recommend
  you implement a test for your new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would then resubmit your patch with the added testing
  functionality, and — assuming everyone was happy with the
  implementation — your reviewers would give the go-ahead to merge
  your patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage of course, the rest of the codebase might have
  changed: some other patches might have landed before yours. So, the
  entire pipeline — including tests that predated your patch, the new
  tests your patch introduced, and the new tests that &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; patches
  might have added in the interim — would re-run with the current
  state of the codebase with your patch applied. If your patch broke
  things &lt;em&gt;now,&lt;/em&gt; you would be asked to fix them once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if your change &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; break anything even now, then there
  would be no human blocking the merge anymore: as soon as the tests
  passed, &lt;em&gt;the thing that ran the tests&lt;/em&gt; (I don’t recall if in 2008 we
  already had the term “CI pipeline” for that thing) would merge the
  patch on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this automation was brand new innovation at the time, largely
due to the work of Drizzle developer Monty Taylor — who later went on
to becoming a highly influential engineer in other projects, which
(among many other things) &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/04/new-hackers-taylor/"&gt;landed him a profile in WIRED in
2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drizzle team also was pretty diligent about what they considered
“breaking things:” for example, the Drizzle test suite contained
several performance benchmarks. If a patch made the server perform
worse, i.e. introduced a performance regression, that would be treated
the same as a functional regression. So you not only would be unable
to land a patch that actually broke functionality or made the database
server eat data; you would also be unable to land a patch that made
the server slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drizzle team is also where, to the best of my knowledge, a coinage
for this kind of approach originated: “gated commits”, or “gating” in
general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is this relevant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A substantial fraction on the Drizzle core team — which had moved to
Rackspace in 2010 — was instrumental in launching another project that
came out of that company (and NASA) that same year:
&lt;a href="https://openstack.org"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;. And OpenStack took the gating
approach from its humble beginnings with Drizzle to an absolutely
massive scale in its hype years (2011 – 2015 or thereabouts) — so much
so that it established a new default in collaborative software
projects.  Many other projects that launched in that timeframe
(including &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io"&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt;) adopted this approach as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, having automated CI testing on every submitted patch is
considered par for the course in a collaborative software project.
&lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/"&gt;GitLab CI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration"&gt;GitHub Actions
workflows&lt;/a&gt;
have made these much more accessible than they used to be with Hudson
and Jenkins. It’s also exceedingly common to do detailed collaborative
reviews in a public forum before merging — GitHub’s PR review workflow
is ever more closely approaching the Gerrit review workflow that
OpenStack uses. GitHub’s &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request"&gt;auto-merge
functionality&lt;/a&gt;
(which lands patches automatically once they have passed both
automated unit tests and human review) is more or less a direct copy
of the automated merge found in OpenStack’s &lt;a href="https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-manual/latest/developers.html#development-workflow"&gt;development
workflow&lt;/a&gt;,
which itself can be directly traced back to Drizzle’s review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all these things are found in open source software projects across
all sorts of communities. Kubernetes, Terraform,
&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/python/cpython"&gt;CPython&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://openedx.org"&gt;Open
edX&lt;/a&gt; — you name it, it probably uses an approach
first pioneered in Drizzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the real lasting legacy of a project that few people even
remember by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who do we owe this to?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some of the Drizzle developers personally, though certainly not
all. What follows is an incomplete list of people you can buy a meal
or a drink if you run into them, and you like the way you
collaboratively develop software today:&lt;/p&gt;

With meat, or vegan.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is inspired by a dish that goes by “Mongolian beef” in parts of
the U.S., but I opted for the generic title since it’s neither
Mongolian, nor does it require beef. It works with any red meat, but
you can also leave the meat out altogether, at which point this
becomes a vegan dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I normally serve this with jasmine or basmati rice. I have yet to try
it with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udon"&gt;udon&lt;/a&gt;, which I am
guessing should work well too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amounts are for 4 servings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meat (optional):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 400g of red meat (beef flank steak, or leg of lamb)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 tbsp soy sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tbsp rice vinegar (or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaoxing_wine"&gt;Shaoxing
  wine&lt;/a&gt;, for a finer
  flavor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tbsp sesame oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-4 tbsp cornstarch or potato starch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4-5 tbsp peanut oil (for frying)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tbsp peanut oil (for frying)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 cloves garlic, finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-2 red bell peppers, cut into 2cm squares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 hot chili pepper, seeds removed (alternatively a jalapeño pepper,
  if you like it milder), chopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;180g (drained) bamboo shoots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-6 scallions (spring onions), cut diagonally into 2-3cm pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sauce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tbsp granulated sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 tbsp soy sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tbsp &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoisin_sauce"&gt;hoisin sauce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tbsp sesame seeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tbsp cornstarch or potato starch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tbsp rice vinegar (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 small bowl (for sauce)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 medium-size bowl (for meat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking knife and board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whisk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large skillet or wok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare the sauce: whisk sugar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame
   seeds, and optionally rice vinegar together in a small bowl and set
   aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re including the meat: prepare the marinade by whisking all
   liquid ingredients together in a medium bowl. Cut the meat into
   very thin strips and put them in the bowl. Marinate for at least 20
   minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toss the meat in the cornstarch or potato starch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat peanut oil in the skillet or wok on high heat. Fry the meat in
   batches until the starch turns golden brown, about 3 minutes or so
   per batch, keeping heat on high. Put fried meat aside in a bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetable fry: heat peanut oil in wok or skillet on high
   heat. Sauté garlic until fragrant but not brown. Add bell peppers,
   chili pepper, and bamboo shoots. Continue frying on high heat for
   about a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the cut scallions, mix thoroughly. Cover skillet or wok with a
   lid, and cook vegetables for about 5 minutes in their own
   steam. Taste the scallions. If they’ve lost their onion punch and
   developed a slightly sweet taste but still retain some crunch,
   they’re perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If going for the meat option, return the fried meat to the wok or
   skillet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour the sauce prepared in step 1 over everthing, mix thoroughly,
   and keep cooking for another 30-60 seconds until sauce thickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

frequently brought up in conversations to remind people that a proposal
that they’re making will, while being intended to simplify things,
actually make them more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people quote that strip to satirize or even ridicule the idea of
introducing a “15th standard”, as if the natural order of things was
simplification. Such people are frequently baffled by the amount of
cruft and clutter that accumulates over time in an organization they
work in, and some of them embark on a constant — perhaps career-long —
quest of “streamlining,” “process optimization,” or “reducing
technical debt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are one such person, please get ready for some bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as we know, there are three fundamental theories that,
combined, explain the universe as we know it: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity"&gt;general
relativity&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics"&gt;quantum mechanics&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics"&gt;thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt;. Thermodynamics
has a famous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics"&gt;Second
Law&lt;/a&gt; that
can be stated in various ways — in one modern and simplified form, we
say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total entropy of a system never decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Entropy,” in this context, is &lt;a href="https://openstax.org/books/physics/pages/12-3-second-law-of-thermodynamics-entropy"&gt;essentially the degree to which the
system is
disorderly&lt;/a&gt;.
In effect, the Second Law states that any system can stay just as
orderly as it is now, or it can become more disorderly, but in can
never again become as orderly as it once was. &lt;strong&gt;The normal state of
the world is that things keep getting more and more disorderly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple classic examples of this: you can mix two paints in
a bucket but cannot unmix them, you can open a container of gas in a
vacuum chamber and the gas will disperse but never go back into the
container, you can scramble and cook and egg but never return it to
its original protein structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the growth in entropy isn’t noticeable: you can of course
pick up your cluttered desk and put everything neatly away in boxes or
drawers (or the trash), and your office will look nice and clean and
uncluttered thereafter. But, in the process you will have turned so
much of your body’s energy into heat that the overall disorder in the
“system” (consisting of the things in your office, the room, you, all
the gas molecules in the air, and so forth) will have gone up quite
considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I realize that not all laws of physics can be directly applied on
a macro scale, that is, to organizations, families, or societies. For
example, you’ll have to go through various mind-bends to imagine your
life as a path through gazillions of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation"&gt;Everettian many-worlds
bifurcations&lt;/a&gt;.
But I’d posit that the constant growth of entropy is indeed rather
fundamental — after all, growth in entropy is one of our best
definitions of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time#Thermodynamic_arrow_of_time"&gt;passage of
time&lt;/a&gt;.
Escaping the growth of entropy is literally just as impossible as
stopping time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean for each of us, individually? It means, bluntly
speaking, that our lives get objectively and perpetually messier over
time. I don’t know if you’re in a better or worse place than you were
10 or 20 years ago in your life, but I’m pretty sure that you’re in a
more &lt;em&gt;complicated&lt;/em&gt; place now. And many of us might probably &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to
go back to our less-complicated life from back then, but alas,
backwards time travel (and hence entropy reduction, read: “a more
orderly life”) is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as long as you’re just trying (and failing) to rewind disorder in
your own life, then — as long as you live and work alone — that will
probably not have a harmful effect on anyone. But it gets tricky when
you’re applying the same thinking to living with a spouse, or in a
family. Good luck trying to rewind your life with teenage offspring,
for example, to the presumably simpler time when they were three month
old babies that slept most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s also talk about how this affects your work in a management
position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a manager, it is your job to slow the growth of disorder
in your part of the organization.&lt;/strong&gt; You won’t be able to &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt;
disorder, and any attempt to do so pits you against a most fundamental
law of physics. (Laws of physics are like terrorists: you shouldn’t
attempt to negotiate with them.) However, many managers are exactly
the opposite: they are entropy accelerators; they &lt;em&gt;speed up&lt;/em&gt; the
growth of disorder in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do better than that.&lt;sup id="fnref:hadfield"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hadfield"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Here are a few suggestions you
can apply when dealing with your management peers, so you can act as
your organization’s entropy decelerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody wants to replace multiple existing things with one new
  thing (the original xkcd 927 scenario): the only circumstance under
  which you should agree to this is when you already know &lt;em&gt;for
  certain&lt;/em&gt; that the existing things must go away, within a manageable
  timeframe. For example, the software solutions that your company has
  been buying from one vendor have had such a massive price hike that
  they now break the budget, or the legal ramifications of continuing
  to use them have become untenable. That’s when you have an option of
  possibly replacing two (or three) things with one. Under all other
  circumstances, you can hope to replace one thing with one other, at
  best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody wants to solve a communications issue by adding more
  channels to your company chat, more categories to your issue
  tracker, more whatever? That’s your cue to stop that dead in its
  tracks. Opening more lanes of communication never simplifies
  anything; it always makes things more complicated. Those new chat
  channels? Tit for tat. They want three new ones, so they must retire
  three. No, not two. Three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody wants to “open up team communications”, or “flatten the
  organization”, so that everyone’s &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2022/01/16/flat-org-scaling/"&gt;complete
  graph&lt;/a&gt; has way more edges?
  That’s when you educate them about &lt;span class="math"&gt;\({n(n-1)}\over 2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and what
  quadratic growth means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you notice how &lt;strong&gt;a lot of these involve saying “no” to someone,&lt;/strong&gt;
and that that may place you at odds with the the well-meaning
proponent? Congratulations on your realization that leadership is not
a popularity contest among your management colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word of caution though: even if you fight this good fight — and
trust me, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a good fight — you will &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; occasionally look
back at when you started working in your organization, and realize
that despite all your efforts it’s a messier place than when you
started. Not just the whole organization, but maybe even your own team
or whatever your little corner of the corporate world is. The part
where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are responsible for your part of the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true if you are just in the middle of leaving an
organization (or a role therein), and are reflecting on the impact of
your tenure: you might fall for the thought of “I tried really hard,
but things still are messier than when I got here.” They always will
be. The point is not to compare today’s degree of disorder to that
when you started. The point is to compare how disorderly it is now, to
how disorderly it would have been if you hadn’t been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:hadfield"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a positive contribution to a group in a leadership
role is frequently — and somewhat counter-intuitively — achieved
by simply focusing on not making things worse for
everyone. Canadian astronaut and former
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"&gt;ISS&lt;/a&gt;
commander &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hadfield"&gt;Chris
Hadfield&lt;/a&gt; calls this
approach “aiming to be a zero” and dedicates a whole chapter in
his excellent &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18170143-an-astronaut-s-guide-to-life-on-earth"&gt;Astronaut’s Guide to Life on
Earth&lt;/a&gt;
to this idea. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hadfield" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/1515233714162356224"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the
Mastodon thread
&lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi/108140619829880299"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have a very decent aggregated feed, thanks to all who responded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, normally, when I put a new post out, I chuck out a link to the
post on those two social networks. For some time, I’d like to do
something different, and if you’re inclined, you can help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I’d ask you to do is subscribe to the &lt;a href="/feeds/all.rss.xml"&gt;RSS
feed&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="/feeds/all.atom.xml"&gt;Atom feed&lt;/a&gt; for my
site. For the next few things I post, I will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; link them on
Twitter or Mastodon — but if you notice them in your feed and find them
share-worthy, I would very much appreciate if &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; posted them there.&lt;sup id="fnref:analytics"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:analytics"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Feel free to tag me in them, I’m &lt;code&gt;@xahteiwi&lt;/code&gt; on Twitter and
&lt;code&gt;@xahteiwi@mastodon.social&lt;/code&gt; on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be really curious to see if it’s feasible in 2022 to reach blog
readers with essentially just an RSS feed, and word-of-mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you would like to participate, then just add my feed to your
reader, and keep your eyes peeled for the next few articles. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to run Google Analytics on this site out of

Here&amp;rsquo;s what that means.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have moved this site to GitHub. It’s still available under the same
URL, of course, but it uses &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;
for hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I do this? A few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/comments/"&gt;comment facility&lt;/a&gt;
  on this site, and I don’t intend to add one, but I do want to give
  people the ability to submit corrections or sugggestions. You can do
  that now, by &lt;a href="https://github.com/fghaas/fghaas.github.io/issues"&gt;creating a GitHub
  issue&lt;/a&gt;, sending
  me a pull request, or doing a &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files"&gt;GitHub
  edit&lt;/a&gt;
  (which is really just a streamlined way of sending a PR from your
  browser).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives me the option to use a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy
  the site fully automatically. As you may know I build this site with
  &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, and wiring up a workflow
  that first sets off a Pelican build and then invokes &lt;code&gt;ghp-import&lt;/code&gt;
  (via &lt;code&gt;tox&lt;/code&gt;) was a breeze. You’re welcome to &lt;a href="https://github.com/fghaas/fghaas.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml"&gt;take a look at the
  implementation&lt;/a&gt;
  if you like. (You can also look at &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html#publishing-to-github"&gt;the relevant
  section&lt;/a&gt;
  in the Pelican docs, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this gives me the ability to do quick edits from almost
  anywhere, and also gives someone else (like you!) the ability to
  suggest fixes, which I can then apply almost instantaneously. But
  please don’t &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; any such things; I do maintain this site on a
  “when I get around to it” basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: if you’ve used this site as a regular or irregular
visitor/reader, not much will change. If however you wanted to chuck
in the occasional fix or correction, you can do that more easily now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If at any point I find that GitHub Pages hosting isn’t the right thing
to after all, I’ll happily rehome the site elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be advised that this is still my site, though, and I maintain
editorial control of all content. If you’re sending me a PR, please do
so with the understanding that I might decline to merge or publish it,
for any reason at all. If that’s not for you, please use your own
platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>The Review Review</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2022/01/29/review-review/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2022-01-29:/blog/2022/01/29/review-review/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Musings on source code management, code review, testing, deployment, and collaboration culture.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share a few thoughts on something I consider a rather
important topic in our industry: code review and CI/CD tools, and how
they relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that I’m talking about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;source code management:&lt;/strong&gt; where we store our code, and how we
  manage access to it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;code review:&lt;/strong&gt; how we coordinate changes to our code;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;testing and gating:&lt;/strong&gt; how we make sure that those changes don’t
  break anything;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deployment:&lt;/strong&gt; how we push changes and updates out to the consumers
  of our code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case it’s not obvious, that means I’m talking about a large
fraction of the software engineering cycle. Not all of it; the part
involving “fooling around” (&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/11/21/creativity/"&gt;creative play&lt;/a&gt;)
is perhaps excluded — but substantially everything where people can be
said to be “developing” in a software engineering organization is
encompassed in these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s a few things that follow from that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, whatever tools we use in order to accomplish these four things,
they simultaneously influence and &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; influenced by our
collaboration culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ludicrous to presume that tools and culture are independent of
each other, or to categorically declare that tools must be made to fit
processes, not the other way around. That’s not how people
work. Culture and tools always have an influence on each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the scope of these things is continually expanding as the
field evolves. To illustrate, a few years ago a CI/CD platform could
get away with supporting automated unit tests and kicking off an
Ansible playbook to deploy things to VMs. Today, what we expect out of
a continuous deployment pipeline includes support for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a package registry (for Python packages or Node.js modules, to give
  just two examples),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a container image registry (for Docker/Podman/OCI containers),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a secret store,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ability to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just a few examples. I might be forgetting others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, this is a classic example of where we must apply &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EbLh7rZ3rhU"&gt;systems
thinking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; since substantially
everything the organization does is connected to the toolchain, we
&lt;strong&gt;cannot make changes to one part of the system without considering
the consequences for the system as a whole.&lt;/strong&gt; That is not to say that
we cannot make incremental changes, just that we can’t pretend that
anything in the system stands alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate what I mean, consider the example of an automotive
engineer implementing a design change for an engine. If the design
change makes the engine so much more efficient that it means a range
extension by 10% then that’s excellent. But if in the process the
designer has made it impossible to connect the engine to its battery
(or the fuel line, if we’re talking about obsolescent technology),
then installing the new engine doesn’t just not improve anything — it
renders the vehicle immobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- Note --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what does that mean about responsibility? Who is ultimately in
charge of the system consisting of source code management and review
tools, and your CI/CD pipeline? The answer is hopefully a no-brainer:
since everything I talk about &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; your organizational culture
encompasses substantially all of your engineering organization, the
responsibility rests with whoever is in charge of your engineering
organization (in most companies, that’s often the CTO). And if you’re
a software technology company so your &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; enterprise is
substantially a software engineering organization, it’s your CEO’s or
MD’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that person may delegate some of the &lt;em&gt;tasks&lt;/em&gt; and details of
running your source code management and code review and CI/CD
platform, but &lt;em&gt;responsibility&lt;/em&gt; stays with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that responsibility requires both an understanding &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2019/04/21/non-technical/"&gt;of the
technology itself&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an understanding
of how it interacts with your engineering culture. A &lt;em&gt;profound&lt;/em&gt;
understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’d go so far as to say if you head up a software engineering
organization and you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have a profound understanding of this
toolchain and its mutual influence on your culture, you should find
another job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you work &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; a software engineering organization and the
person in charge lacks precisely that profound understanding, you
should &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; find another job, because you deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So having said all that, we can start talking about tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m going to talk about three of them, all of which I use in some
professional capacity on an at-least-weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- .slide: data-timing="20" --&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;GitHub&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is the toolchain that — I think — a majority of open
source developers will be most familiar with: GitHub, whose
collaboration model is based on the &lt;em&gt;Pull Request&lt;/em&gt; (PR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the GitHub PR model was strongly influenced by the distributed
development model of the Linux kernel. The kernel project is what Git
was originally written for, so naturally it is also where the original
convention for pull requests emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In kernel development, during a kernel merge window, subsystem
maintainers fix up a publicly accessible Git tree for Linus to pull
from. They then send a message that follows a conventional format to
the &lt;code&gt;linux-kernel&lt;/code&gt; mailing list (the LKML) outlining the purpose of
the changes they want merged. This email contains a summary of the
changes, and then an enumeration of each commit to be merged. (There’s
a &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; subcommand, &lt;code&gt;git request-pull&lt;/code&gt;, to format such a message.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review then proceeds in an email exchange on LKML. Once Linus is
happy with the change, he pulls from the subsystem maintainer’s branch
and informs them that their changes have merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual subsystem maintainers replicate this model, perhaps with
small modifications, for contributions to the subsystems they are
responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub Pull Requests (PRs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub replicates some features of the kernel’s model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The collaboration model is generally, “fork and pull”. Individuals
  maintain their own forks of an upstream codebase, and then send pull
  requests when they are ready to review. (However, the review process
  then uses a web interface, rather than a mailing list — in
  principle, a GitHub reviewer can do a complete review within the
  GitHub web interface and source code browser and would never even
  need to check out the repository locally.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each PR generally consists of &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; commits, which however are
  expected to closely relate and serve a common purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That common purpose is enumerated in a summary at the top of the
  pull request. GitHub calls this the PR description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submitters can mark a PR as a draft, with which they indicate that
  the PR is not ready to be merged yet. When drafts &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/"&gt;became
  available&lt;/a&gt;
  in 2019, they replaced an emerging convention in which PR
  descriptions would be prefixed by &lt;code&gt;WIP&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;(work in progress)&lt;/em&gt; or
  &lt;code&gt;DNM&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;(do not merge)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub PRs can be &lt;em&gt;approved,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;commented on&lt;/em&gt; by
maintainers or other contributors, and an approval can be made a
mandatory requirement for merging, but by default GitHub will let
anyone merge the PR who has write permissions to the repository that
the PR targets. This includes the possibility for a maintainer to
merge the contributor’s remote branch to their own local checkout, and
then pushing the merged branch to he target repo of the PR. Such an
event will automatically close the PR and mark it as merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub has, for a long time, allowed maintainers to require that PRs
pass automated testing. However, until rather recently, it relied on
them to run (or interface with) a separate testing infrastructure
outside of GitHub to do that. Typical examples for this included
CircleCI, or Travis, or Jenkins. It was only &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/"&gt;in
2019&lt;/a&gt;
that GitHub announced automated testing via GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing however, GitHub Actions workflows are in
widespread use for CI/CD, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; it is still quite common for
GitHub-hosted projects to allow maintainers to circumvent CI/CD tests
and merge directly. When this happens, it often creates a rather
unpleasant situation in which CI/CD testing is only run for
contributions by “outsiders” or “newbies”, whereas maintainers get to
break things with impunity. This means that issues are often not
detected until a casual contributor sends a PR, at which point the
test breaks and leave the contributor confused (and sometimes lead to
the change not even being considered because, well, “it makes the
tests break.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that comes bundled with GitHub (and GitHub workflow
actions) is the ability to maintain your own package registry &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows/publishing-and-installing-a-package-with-github-actions"&gt;and
push artifacts to it from your
workflow&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly,
at the time of writing, GitHub’s definition of “packages” includes
container images, Ruby gems, and npm modules &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry"&gt;among
others&lt;/a&gt;,
but presently does not include Python modules — although you do, of
course, have the option to &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish"&gt;push your packages to PyPI from your
workflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;GitLab&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equivalent to the GitHub &lt;em&gt;pull request (PR)&lt;/em&gt; is the GitLab &lt;em&gt;merge
request (MR)&lt;/em&gt;. In principle, a GitLab MR is quite similar to a GitHub
PR, albeit with a few noticeable differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “fork and pull” model is less prevalent on GitLab. Instead, it
  is far more common for collaborators to work on one project, and
  then create topic branches within that project for each set of
  changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the project repo is shared, this facilitates collaboration on
  a single changeset by multiple people: if two or more people wish to
  collaborate on a change, they simply push additional squash or fixup
  commits on the topic branch. They can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; agree to force-push
  amended commits to the topic branch, in which the GitLab web
  interface will helpfully point out differences between individual
  &lt;em&gt;versions&lt;/em&gt; of a commit (something that GitHub presently cannot do in
  a PR).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As in a GitHub PR, a GitLab MR is generally expected to include one
  or more commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also as in a GitHub PR, an MR is expected to contain a summary that
  outlines its purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitLab MRs have a Draft status just like GitHub PRs do, and they
  were introduced about the same time in both products, but GitLab had
  a preceding feature called work-in-progress MRs (WIP MRs). GitLab
  has the handy feature that MRs are &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; marked as drafts
  once any commit with &lt;code&gt;squash:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fixup:&lt;/code&gt; in the commit message
  ends up in the topic branch — GitLab rightfully infers that the
  branch still needs a squash rebase prior to merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitLab MRs can be reviewed in full using the web interface alone:
  the review interface and the source code browser are closely
  integrated, just like in GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitLab CI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI/CD has been an intrinsic part of the GitLab review
experience for years, since GitLab includes full CI integration via
the &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt; configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since GitLab CI has been around for quite a while, and it has a
multitude of ways to be used, it “feels” more intrinsic to the review
process than GitHub Actions do, which to me still leave an impression
of being bolted on. In addition, GitLab CI comes with multiple options
of using the CI &lt;em&gt;runner:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;em&gt;shared runners,&lt;/em&gt; which GitLab operates for you. These
  are Docker containers that GitLab spins up on your behalf in the
  cloud, and which you share with other GitLab subscription customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also host your own runners. You can do that in Docker
  containers, in Kubernetes clusters, in virtual machines, and even on
  bare metal. The runners need no incoming network connectivity; they
  simply connect to a service on your GitLab host and then poll
  whether jobs wait for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also specify runners that are exclusive to a project, or to
  a group or subgroup of projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab also comes with a &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/"&gt;package
registry&lt;/a&gt;,
to which you can push packages from CI pipelines. This differs from
GitHub in such a way that it &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/#supported-package-managers"&gt;includes more package different
formats&lt;/a&gt;,
including a private PyPI workalike for Python packages. In addition,
there’s also a separate &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/"&gt;container
registry&lt;/a&gt;
for container images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gerrit/Zuul&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it feels a bit awkward to call this one “Gerrit/Zuul” when I’ve
called the others just “GitHub” and “GitLab” respectively, and tacitly
included the corresponding CI integrations (GitHub Actions and GitLab
CI, respectively) in them. There are a couple of reasons for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuul is a CI/CD framework that is, in principle, not tied to Gerrit,
  whereas GitHub Actions only apply to GitHub, and GitLab CI only to
  GitLab. Gerrit/Zuul is a particular combination that was largely
  popularized by the OpenStack community, which is why a lot of people
  who are or were part of that community intuitively associate Gerrit
  with Zuul and vice versa.
  &lt;!-- It should be noted that Zuul was not the original CI/CD framework in
  the OpenStack community. It was *developed* (and adopted) by that
  community when it found that it was outgrowing the boundaries of its
  original CI/CD platform (Jenkins). --&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Gerrit is not tied to a specific CI/CD framework. It’s
  perfectly feasible to run code reviews in Gerrit and use a different
  CI/CD pipeline (or even none at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Gerrit/Zuul does differ quite notably from GitHub and GitLab,
whose features often map quite closely to each other, and I’d like to
highlight some of those differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gerrit reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gerrit review process differs in a few crucial points from the one
we know from GitHub and GitLab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t ask someone to pull from a branch or a fork or
  yours. Instead, you run &lt;code&gt;git review&lt;/code&gt; and Gerrit will &lt;em&gt;make a branch
  for you.&lt;/em&gt; Everything else flows from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a GitHub PR and GitLab MR, which both typically contain a
  series of commits to be taken as a whole, a Gerrit &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; is
  really just that: one change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, of course, also means that we don’t need a separate summary
  for the change: the summary is the commit message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still possible to submit a series of commits in the course of a
  Gerrit review. However, Gerrit simply sees those as a series of
  changes that all depend on one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependencies between changes can also be expressed explicitly, by
  including appropriate keywords in commit messages. Crucially, these
  dependencies &lt;em&gt;can cross project boundaries.&lt;/em&gt; That is to say, a
  change in one Git repository can depend on a change in &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; Git
  repository, so long as they both use the same Gerrit instance for
  review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we also have the equivalent of a Draft PR/MR; in Gerrit that’s
  called a work-in-progress change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, when used in combination with CI such as Zuul, a
Gerrit-reviewed project generally expects CI tests to pass &lt;em&gt;on every
commit,&lt;/em&gt; without exceptions. This is in contrast to many GitHub or
GitLab managed projects, which typically only expect the head commit
of the topic branch associated with a PR/MR to pass CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gerrit/Zuul managed projects, it’s also Zuul that merges the
commit. This is also in contrast to projects that live in GitHub or
GitLab: in those, the pipeline run results are generally advisory in
nature, and a successful pipeline run must still be confirmed by a
human clicking a &lt;em&gt;Merge&lt;/em&gt; button (or running a &lt;code&gt;git merge&lt;/code&gt; command
locally, and then pushing to the repository). In addition, even a
failing CI run can generally be overridden by a “core committer” who
has the ability to merge the PR/MR anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Gerrit/Zuul project typically has no such shortcuts, meaning the
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to get changes into the repo is to pass both peer review,
and the CI pipeline. In my experience, this tends to create a climate
of leadership by example, which has a beneficial effect on both
experienced developers (“seniors” in a corporate setting) and
newcomers (“juniors”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speculative merging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one other property that Gerrit/Zuul has that sets it apart
from other review/CI toolchains: &lt;em&gt;speculative merging.&lt;/em&gt; This involves
the &lt;a href="https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/3.10.2/user/gating.html#testing-in-parallel"&gt;parallel execution of CI jobs for interdependent
changes&lt;/a&gt;. With
speculative merging, even complex, long-running CI/CD pipelines don’t
hold up the development process — and this massively enhances project
scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No direct repo browser integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, in Gerrit/Zuul there is no close integration with repository
browsing. Gerrit does include the
&lt;a href="https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitiles/"&gt;Gitiles&lt;/a&gt; plugin for the
purpose, but its user experience is rudimentary at best. A popular
alternative is to deploy Gerrit with &lt;a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/"&gt;Gitea&lt;/a&gt;,
but again, that’s not built-in and your trusted Gerrit/Zuul admin has
to set it up for you. In addition, while source code browsing in
GitHub and GitLab is tightly integrated with project permissions, and
that is also true for Gitiles, there is a certain amount of
administrative duplication to make your Gerrit repository and project
permissions apply to Gitea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No built-in package registries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another difference in the Gerrit/Zuul stack when compared to
GitHub and GitLab, and that is its absence of built-in package
registries. Zuul has ready-to-use &lt;em&gt;jobs&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul-jobs/docker-image.html"&gt;pushing to a container
registry&lt;/a&gt;, or to
&lt;a href="https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul-jobs/python-jobs.html#job-python-upload-pypi"&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt;,
but you do have to either push to upstream public registries, or build
your own. Zuul does not come bundled with multitenant private
registries the way GitHub and GitLab do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Administrative complexity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the above, there’s another thing that you might want to
consider, which in my humble opinion is an important reason why the
Gerrit/Zuul combination has less uptake than it deserves on its
technical merits. And this may sound overly dramatic, but: people like
to be in charge of their own actions, and software developers are
people. And here’s an issue with Zuul: there are quite a few things a
developer can do on their own in GitHub Actions or GitLab CI that
they’d need to ask an admin’s help for in Zuul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a relatively standard workflow of building a private
container image, pushing it to your own registry, and then rolling out
that image to a Kubernetes deployment, is something you can do in
GitHub or GitLab as a project owner. With Zuul, you’ll need an admin
at least to set up and manage your container registry. Rerunning a
pipeline, a simple click of a button or API call in GitHub or GitLab,
is something you trigger via a Gerrit keyword (typically &lt;code&gt;recheck&lt;/code&gt;)
for Zuul — but only on the pipelines where &lt;a href="https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/3.11.0/admin/drivers/gerrit.html#reference-pipelines-configuration"&gt;your admin has defined
that
trigger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So, which one’s best?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want to know which one of these &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; should choose (or
advocate for)? That’s surprisingly difficult to answer, and greatly
depends on your priorities. And I’ll give you this from four angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to &lt;em&gt;scalability&lt;/em&gt; — the ability to adapt to massive
  organizational sizes, and/or rapid project growth, or an obscenely
  large number or projects within an organization — the Gerrit/Zuul
  combination wins hands down &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; you have a competent, responsive,
  and dedicated crew to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it’s about &lt;em&gt;getting started quickly&lt;/em&gt; — helping a project get
  off the ground with a good, usable, easily manageable review and
  fully integrated CI/CD structure — you can’t beat GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of &lt;em&gt;beneficial effect on your development culture,&lt;/em&gt;
  Gerrit/Zuul again probably scores best. If you have a team that’s
  great at reviews and commit and CI and doesn’t cut corners, or you
  want to build a team like that, Gerrit/Zuul can really help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when it’s about &lt;em&gt;giving developers the lowest barrier to entry&lt;/em&gt;
  — meaning using tools that they’re most likely already familiar with
  — GitHub is your platform of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

order to better scale the organization as we grow, we need to keep it
flat.” The thrust of the argument is that as the organization grows to
meet customer and demand growth (and with it, growth in head count),
additional levels of corporate hierarchy stifle that growth, and
should thus be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any knowledge-driven organization this is wrong, and just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;
wrong it is can be proven, numerically, with simple high school level
maths. And in this context, “knowledge-driven organization”
encompasses any technology company, any software engineering outfit,
any technology services provider — in short, any organization that
makes its money off the brains of its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s establish a few self-evident facts about knowledge-driven
organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people who actually “make things happen” are the ones with no
   direct reports. The frontend designers, the infrastructure
   engineers, the backend specialists, the data analysts. Their
   managers (and &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; managers, and everyone else all the way up to
   the CEO) are charged with aggregating information, making
   decisions, removing obstacles to productivity, and perhaps
   providing some form of vision and guidance. But it’s individual,
   non-managerial contributors of all specializations that actually
   &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In doing so, engineers work best in small teams with a great degree
   of autonomy. They will usually benefit from close working
   relationships with a small group of people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A manager’s role is thus twofold: remove any obstacles that stand
   in the way of the team accomplishing its goals, and act as an
   interface to other parts of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s consider a hypothetical small company that is
currently structured in teams of 5. There’s always 4 people reporting
to one manager. Currently, that company is made up as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CEO/founder, Alex (1 person),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 team leads (4 people),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 employees on each team, all of whom report to the respective team
  lead (in total, 16 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, 21 people in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management theory calls the number of reports per manager in an
organization the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_of_control"&gt;&lt;em&gt;span of
control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t like
that term a great deal. For one thing, at four syllables it’s a bit of
a mouthful, particularly if it needs to mentioned frequently. But more
importantly, it’s not an accurate reflection of reality: in a
knowledge-driven organization (like any technology or engineering
company), it’s ludicrous to think that a manager “controls” their
reports like puppets or robots. So, I’ll use a different term for the
remainder of this article: I’m going to call the number of reports per
manager the &lt;strong&gt;width&lt;/strong&gt; of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I’ll use the term &lt;strong&gt;depth&lt;/strong&gt; for the number of hierarchy levels
that the company has. A sole proprietorship has a depth of zero. A
company with a founder-CEO and a few employees, but no other managers,
has a depth of 1. Alex’ company, with one level of management
reporting to Alex, and everyone else reporting to one of those
managers, currently has a depth of 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can say that Alex’ company is currently &lt;em&gt;narrow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shallow&lt;/em&gt; —
it has small teams, and few management levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the company has just closed a major funding round and several big
customer deals, putting them on a solid growth trajectory. So, Alex
expects the company to double in headcount on an annual basis for the
foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question is: is it better for the organization to stick to the
current width, and add depth as it grows, or should Alex increase its
width, so that it can accomodate more people while retaining a
shallower depth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, as the company scales, should it become &lt;em&gt;deeper&lt;/em&gt; while
staying &lt;em&gt;narrow&lt;/em&gt;, or should it grow &lt;em&gt;wider&lt;/em&gt; while staying &lt;em&gt;shallow?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fast-forward five years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at that, Alex mentally fast-forwards five years under the
currently assumed growth model. After five years of doubling in
headcount, the company now has &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(21 \cdot 2^5 = 672\)&lt;/span&gt; employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, everyone in the company works still works in a
5-person team, out of which one person is the leader. So every leader
has 4 people that report to them. Let’s look at one employee, Sam. Sam
works in a team with Joe, Jane, Harry and Ruth, and Ruth is the team
lead. Let’s say her title is simply, “Manager”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruth now has at most 3 peers of her own, and reports to someone who
goes by “Senior Manager,” putting her in another team of no more than
5 at her management level. That Senior Manager has at most 3 peers again, all
of whom report to a Director. A Director also, together with a maximum
of 3 other Directors, reports to a VP, and the 4 VPs work together
under Alex, who is still the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ll tell you that for 672 people, you’ll not nearly have filled
all those 5-person teams. But try to intuitively guess, without doing
the math, what organizational size this structure would
accommodate. That is to say, with every person in the company being at
most 5 hops away from the CEO, and everyone working in a group of 5,
what’s the maximum company size this model can handle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is 1,365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s quickly break that down and see how we can plug other numbers in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A gentle bit of maths, part I: team size and hierarchy levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we take company’s &lt;em&gt;width&lt;/em&gt;, that is the number of people working
together in any group, &lt;em&gt;excluding&lt;/em&gt; the leader, as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;. In our example,
that’s &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(4\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, any team’s size (which we’ll call &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;, for reasons we’ll get to
in a jiffy) is of course &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x+1=5\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people any Senior Manager is reponsible for is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((x+1)x +
1 = x^2+x+1 = 21\)&lt;/span&gt; (that is, their Manager’s teams, and themselves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people any Director is responsible for is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(((x+1)x+1)x+1
= x^3+x^2+x+1 = 85\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see where this is going. For any additional level of &lt;em&gt;depth&lt;/em&gt;, we
simply need to add another power of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1 = x^0\)&lt;/span&gt; — at the zeroth depth level there’s one
single person: the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can express the number of people in an organization with a width
of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; and a depth of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; as
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + ... + x^y$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, more briefly:&lt;sup id="fnref:i"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:i"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\sum_{i=0}^{y} x^{i}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, in turn, &lt;a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i2d=true&amp;amp;i=Sum%5BPower%5Bx%2Cn%5D%2C%7Bn%2C0%2Cy%7D%5D"&gt;happens to work out
to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:indeterminate"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:indeterminate"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$${x^{y+1}-1} \over {x-1}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug in the numbers for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=4\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=5\)&lt;/span&gt;, and we get 1,365. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A gentle bit of maths, part II: communications in complete graphs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what’s our scaling constraint in a knowledge organization? The
number of people you need to constantly be in touch with in order to
accomplish your goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Sam, those people are principally your Sam’s teammates team
colleagues, including their manager, Ruth. That’s 4 people. However,
it’s not enough for Sam to understand what &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; is exchanging with
Jane, Joe, Harry, and Ruth; it’s also imperative for him to understand
what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; communicate about. So, Sam needs to keep himself
appraisedof what Ruth told Harry, or what information Jane gave to
Joe, and how Joe and Harry are coordinating their latest change
(etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that &lt;strong&gt;within a team, communications are a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph"&gt;complete
graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. And for a
complete graph, the number of &lt;em&gt;edges&lt;/em&gt; is given by &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$${n(n-1)}\over 2$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; is our team size (including the leader), thus
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x+1\)&lt;/span&gt; (the reports plus the leader). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can rewrite the complete-graph formula as: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$${{(x+1)(x+1-1)} \over 2} = {{x(x+1)} \over 2}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in order for the team to be well informed of everyone’s
actions at all times, a 5-person team must keep track of 10
communications links between people. That’s absolutely doable, though
we must keep in mind that the number of links does not grow linearly
with the number of people in direct communications which each other,
but it grows proportionally to the &lt;em&gt;square&lt;/em&gt; of that number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam’s manager Ruth, of course, works on &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; 5-person teams: Sam’s,
and Ruth’s team of fellow Managers reporting to a Senior Manager. That
means Ruth needs to constantly keep in touch with the people on her
team (including Sam), and also understand what everyone on her team of
Managers is doing. Thus, she keeps track of 20 communications
links. This is also true for her Senior Manager, that Senior Manager’s
Director, and that Director’s VP. It’s only at the very top that the
CEO has the luxury of directly managing only 4 VPs.&lt;sup id="fnref:c-suite"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:c-suite"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This should be flatter! Or should it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose someone tells Alex that in this growth plan the
organization is much too hierarchical, and the organization must thus
lose some of its projected hierarchy levels — that is, reduce its
depth. Of course, the only way to do that while still being able to
manage the same headcount growth is to make the company wider — in
other words, have more people report to one manager than previously
planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Alex, being a good CEO, opens some spread sheet software and
creates this handy table that simply plugs in values for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;,
with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; (width) in columns and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; (depth) in rows.&lt;sup id="fnref:table"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:table"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table-striped table"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;6&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;9&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;43&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;57&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;91&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;133&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;156&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;259&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;585&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;820&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,464&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;121&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;341&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;781&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,555&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,801&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4,681&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7,381&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16,105&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;63&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;364&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,365&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,906&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,331&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19,608&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;37,449&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;66,430&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;177,156&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,093&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,461&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19,531&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;55,987&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;137,257&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;299,593&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;597,871&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,948,717&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,280&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21,845&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;97,656&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;335,923&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;960,800&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,396,745&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,380,840&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21,435,888&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;511&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,841&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;87,381&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;488,281&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,015,539&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6,725,601&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19,173,961&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48,427,561&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;111,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;235,794,769&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;29,524&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;349,525&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,441,406&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12,093,235&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;47,079,208&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;153,391,689&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;435,848,050&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,111,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,593,742,460&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,047&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;88,573&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,398,101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12,207,031&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;72,559,411&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;329,554,457&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,227,133,513&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,922,632,451&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,111,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28,531,167,061&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our previous five-year plan, Alex can just look up the cell
matching &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=4\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=5\)&lt;/span&gt; and finds our known outcome, a maximum head
count of 1,365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Alex looks at what it takes to flatten the organization by
eliminating one hierarchy level, or by two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to reduce depth by 1, we simply go up one row (thus,
  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=4\)&lt;/span&gt;) and find the value for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; that just accommodates 1,365
  people or more. Alex sees that that’s &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=6\)&lt;/span&gt;, which can accommodate
  1,555 people. That is, increase the width by 2: reorganize from
  teams of 5 to teams of 7. Alex could also pick &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=5\)&lt;/span&gt;, that is
  increase the width by only 1, which would land the company at a
  maximum head count of 781. That is well below what &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=4\)&lt;/span&gt; can handle,
  but it still lands Alex north of the original growth target of 672.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to reduce depth by 2, we go up two rows (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=3\)&lt;/span&gt;) and do
  the same. We end up at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=11\)&lt;/span&gt;, which means to increase width by 7:
  reorganize from teams of 5 to teams of 12. Thus, we land at a
  maximum of 1,464 people, slightly exceeding the headcount we’re able
  to accommodate if we keep growing with the current structure. We
  could also do &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=10\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=9\)&lt;/span&gt;, landing us at maxima well below that
  (1,111 or 820), but still north of 672.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what does that mean in terms of communication channels each person
has to maintain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, what we want to keep in mind is the number of edges in a
complete graph connecting &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; (that is, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x+1\)&lt;/span&gt;) points. For regular
employees, we know that that’s &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$${x(x+1)}\over 2$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for any manager, who is effectively on two teams of size &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x+1\)&lt;/span&gt;
simultaneously, that’s &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$2 \cdot {{x(x+1)}\over 2} = x(x+1)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to reduce depth by 1 and go from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=4\)&lt;/span&gt; to
  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=5\)&lt;/span&gt;, every non-manager employee now needs to be aware of 15
  communications links (instead of 10), every manager, of 30 (instead
  of 20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead we go from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=4\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=6\)&lt;/span&gt;, every non-manager employee now
  needs to be aware of 21 communications links, every manager, of 42.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s a least a 50% increase, or even a doubling, of
communications complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the elimination of two hierarchy levels (a depth reduction by
  2), we’ll need to move from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=4\)&lt;/span&gt; to at least &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=8\)&lt;/span&gt;. At that point,
  every regular employee has at least 36 communications links on their
  teams to deal with; every manager deals with 72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead we go to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=9\)&lt;/span&gt;, every non-manager employee now needs to
  be aware of 45 communications links, every manager, of 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=10\)&lt;/span&gt;, every non-manager employee now needs to
  be aware of 55 communications links, every manager, of 110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Alex realizes that &lt;strong&gt;making the company wide and
shallow, instead of narrow and deep, is painfully expensive in
communication cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But what about all those managers we won’t have to pay?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-meaning advisor interrupts Alex in the middle of planning. He
interjects that Alex is missing a point, namely all the managers that
the company will now no longer need, and the cost savings thus
generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Alex looks at the table again (width in columns, depth in rows):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table-striped table"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;6&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;9&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;43&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;57&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;91&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;133&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;156&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;259&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;585&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;820&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,464&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;121&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;341&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;781&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,555&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,801&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4,681&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7,381&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16,105&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;63&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;364&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,365&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,906&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,331&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19,608&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;37,449&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;66,430&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;177,156&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,093&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,461&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19,531&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;55,987&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;137,257&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;299,593&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;597,871&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,948,717&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,280&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21,845&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;97,656&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;335,923&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;960,800&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,396,745&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,380,840&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21,435,888&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;511&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,841&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;87,381&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;488,281&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,015,539&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6,725,601&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19,173,961&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48,427,561&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;111,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;235,794,769&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;29,524&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;349,525&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,441,406&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12,093,235&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;47,079,208&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;153,391,689&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;435,848,050&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,111,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,593,742,460&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,047&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;88,573&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,398,101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12,207,031&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;72,559,411&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;329,554,457&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,227,133,513&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,922,632,451&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,111,111,111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28,531,167,061&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s handy here is that Alex can look at any one table cell, and the
cell &lt;em&gt;directly above it&lt;/em&gt; will contain the total number of managers
(that is, people who have direct reports) for the same width. So,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=4\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=5\)&lt;/span&gt; (our original scenario allowing the company to grow
  to 1,365 people), Alex would have to hire and pay a total of 341
  managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=6\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=4\)&lt;/span&gt; (the scenario that eliminates one level, and can
  accommodate 1,555 people), Alex’ company will need 259
  managers. That’s 82 fewer managers, or a reduction by about 24%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=5\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=4\)&lt;/span&gt; (the scenario that eliminates one level, but
  accommodates only 781 people), Alex’ company will need 156
  managers. That’s 185 fewer managers, or a reduction by about 54%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=11\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=3\)&lt;/span&gt; (the scenario that eliminates two levels, and can
  accommodate 1,464 people), the company will need 133
  managers. That’s 208 fewer managers, or a reduction by about 61%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=10\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=3\)&lt;/span&gt; (the scenario that eliminates two levels, but
  accommodates only 1,111 people), the company will need 111
  managers. That’s 230 fewer managers, or a reduction by about 67%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x=9\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=3\)&lt;/span&gt; (the scenario that eliminates two levels, but
  accommodates only 820 people), the company will need 91
  managers. That’s 250 fewer managers, or a reduction by about 73%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A gentle bit of maths, part III: how much of our company will be managers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It so happens that we can generalize this. If Alex looks at our table
again, but considers the number of managers proportional to the number
of people in the company, a pattern quickly emerges (again, width
is in columns, depth is in rows):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table-striped table"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;6&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;9&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;33.33%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16.67%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.29%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11.11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.09%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.33%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;42.86%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30.77%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;23.81%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19.35%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16.28%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.04%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.33%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10.99%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.91%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.02%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46.67%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32.50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24.71%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19.87%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16.60%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.48%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11.10%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.99%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.08%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48.39%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;33.06%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24.93%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19.97%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16.66%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.28%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11.11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.09%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;49.98%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;16.67%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.29%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;11.11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.09%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll see that at a depth of 1, the share of managers is obviously &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1
\over {x+1}\)&lt;/span&gt;, but then as we increase in depth it quickly trends
toward:&lt;sup id="fnref:reciprocal"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:reciprocal"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$1 \over x$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of managers in Alex’ company is roughly the reciprocal of
the company’s width. In other words, the number of managers is
inversely proportional to width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the cost of communications is directly proportional to
the &lt;em&gt;square&lt;/em&gt; of the width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Alex realizes that &lt;strong&gt;while there are indeed savings to
be made by the elimination of management in a wide-and-shallow
company, they cannot possibly balance the added communication cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: the cost in communications inefficiency grows much
faster with width, so much so that it will eat up Alex’ company’s
manager payroll savings several times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;In summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “flat” (wide) organization scales poorly. Its growth in
communication cost far outpaces its savings in payroll cost. And it
scales progressively worse, the “flatter” (wider) it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:i"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation#Capital-sigma_notation"&gt;capital-sigma summation
formula&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; doesn’t mean anything other than it being a counter. The
formula is pronounced, in English, as “sum of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;, from
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; equals zero to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;” (in other words, add up all whole-number
powers of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;, from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x^0\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x^y\)&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:i" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:indeterminate"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice that this expression is
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_form"&gt;indeterminate&lt;/a&gt;
for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;. Now I’d say the idea of a hierarchical company made
up of one-on-one teams (every manager has one report, who in turn
is the manager of one report, and so on) is extremely unrealistic.
But just for completeness’ sake, we can apply &lt;a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i2d=true&amp;amp;i=Limit%5BDivide%5BPower%5Bx%2Cy%2B1%5D-1%2Cx-1%5D%2Cx-%3E1%5D"&gt;a
limit&lt;/a&gt;
to show that 
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\lim_{x \to 1} {{x^{y+1}-1} \over {x-1}} = {y + 1}$$&lt;/div&gt; 
In other words, such an organization could accommodate a
number of people that is equal to its depth plus 1. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:indeterminate" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:c-suite"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This why they might also be able to appoint a CFO, CSO,
CTO or whatever other C-suite functions are appropriate for the
organization. So in the scenario we might end up with a handful
more people than 1,365 for the C-suite and perhaps some number of
staff in their offices. But for the purposes of this discussion
those don’t make a big difference, so we’ll disregard them for
now. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:c-suite" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:table"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to compare the bottom rows and rightmost
columns of this table to Wikipedia’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers"&gt;list of largest
employers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:table" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:reciprocal"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, that is because the share of
managers in relation to the total number of people in the company
is 
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$${\sum_{i=0}^{y-1} x^{i}} \over {\sum_{i=0}^{y} x^{i}}$$&lt;/div&gt;
That works out to be &lt;div class="math"&gt;$${x^y-1} \over {x^{y+1}-1}$$&lt;/div&gt;
Which, for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=1\)&lt;/span&gt;, is
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$${{x-1} \over {x^2-1}} = {{x-1} \over {(x+1)\cdot(x-1)}} = {1 \over {x+1}}$$&lt;/div&gt;
And for larger values of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;, both &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x^y\)&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x^{y+1}\)&lt;/span&gt; become so large that the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-1\)&lt;/span&gt; part barely matters, so
it’s effectively: 
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$${{x^y-1} \over {x^{y+1}-1}} \approx {x^y \over x^{y+1}} = {1 \over x}$$&lt;/div&gt;
In slightly more formal terms, we can consider &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1 \over x\)&lt;/span&gt; the 
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)"&gt;limit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the
expression as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; goes to infinity:
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\lim_{y \to \infty} {{x^y-1} \over {x^{y+1}-1}} = {1 \over x}$$&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:reciprocal" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s why I think that that’s a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As of late, I’ve noticed that when people share one of my articles on
asynchronous communications on Twitter (particularly any from the
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/09/30/getting-out-of-meeting-hell/"&gt;Getting out of Meeting
Hell&lt;/a&gt; series, or the one on
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/27/this-meeting-should-have-been-an-email/"&gt;meetings that should have been an
email&lt;/a&gt;), there’s
a reply from a brand account that likes to plug/advertise their
service. That service recommends that synchronous meetings be replaced
by “asynchronous meetings” based on voice messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to point out that I consider that an utterly terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voice is slow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, voice messages suffer from the exact same drawback that
meetings do: they are incredibly slow. Most of us speak at a rate of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_tempo"&gt;approximately 4 syllables per
second&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:speech-tempo"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:speech-tempo"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In
English, that translates to about 120-140 words per minute. That means
that as a listener, you &lt;em&gt;absorb&lt;/em&gt; the content of a voice message at the
same rate. You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; make that a little more efficient by increasing
playback speed, but that’s only feasible to about a 25% speed
increase, which lands you around 150 words per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, unless you are dyslexic (I’ll get to that in a bit) you
can &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; at 240 words per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, conveying a certain amount of information by voice
takes nearly twice as long as doing the same in writing. And that’s if
your verbal expression is &lt;em&gt;perfect,&lt;/em&gt; which it never is — any voice
message will come with its fair share of filler words (“uh”, “um”,
“y’know”) and incomplete sentences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to that the occasional slurred word or phrase, or idioms
unfamiliar to the recipient of the message. If you come across
something that’s unclear while reading, it takes you fractions of a
second to re-read a sentence, and maybe a few seconds to re-read from
the beginning of a paragraph. But in the listening case, it may take
you upward of a minute to go back and re-listen to a passage you
missed or didn’t understand. (Anyone who both reads books and listens
to audiobooks will relate to this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voice is more difficult to follow and retrieve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, voice messages are usually much more difficult to understand
for a recipient listening in their second or third language,
particularly if the other person is a native speaker using an accent
that is unfamiliar to them — say, a French person listening to heavily
Scots-accented English or a pronounced Australian twang. Written
messages might still have their ambiguities — as an example, the word
“doubt” meaning “question”, a common substitution in Indian English,
frequently confuses non-Indian English speakers — but those are &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt;
fewer and easier to resolve for a reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, until speech recognition is perfect and automatic
transcription is thus exquisitely faithful, your voice messages aren’t
searchable. You could say that they’re practically
half-off-the-record. Good luck trying to come back to an important bit
of information that someone conveyed via a voice message that you have
only a vague recollection of. Or, worse, trying to establish the
&lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; in which a decision was made, and having to piece it
together from multiple voice messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voice doesn’t convey as much nuance as you think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the notion that you ought to be using voice messages to add
“nuance” when you can’t convey such nuance in your writing strikes me
as patently ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you need to convey emotion or feeling or nuance to a greater
extent than you would be able to in writing, that is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; a
situation in which you should meet with a person face-to-face,
one-on-one, and where that doesn’t permit itself, get on a video
call. At that point, when a written message won’t cut it, a voice
message absolutely won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One good use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there may be one useful use of voice messages that I can think
of: they may work for people with dyslexia, for whom consuming a lot
of writing &lt;a href="https://a11yrules.com/podcast/kevin-mar-molinero-talks-about-dyscalculia-and-copy-pasting/"&gt;may cause cognitive
overload&lt;/a&gt;. In
that case, voice messages might be a workable alternative. If so, then
that would make the option to communicate via voice message a very
valid accessibility consideration. That said, I’ve talked to people
who are dyslexic and who said that voice messages are not an adequate
substitute for interactive verbal communication to them — but that’s
of course highly anecdotal, and shouldn’t dismiss the idea outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However: even if voice messages are a good thing for people with
dyslexia, though, I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that as screen readers continuously
improve, generating speech from text may a be preferable
option. That’s because it retains the searchability advantage for
everyone, and the efficiency advantage for non-dyslexics, while also
accomodating people with dyslexia. But, I want to re-emphasize that
that’s just a hunch, and I may well be completely wrong. If you’re
dyslexic and have thoughts on this, I’d love to hear from you! Please
find me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:speech-tempo"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun useless fact: the rate of 4 syllables per second
is practically universal across spoken languages. How many &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;
a native speaker of a particular language speaks in a minute
depends largely on the average number of syllables per word in
that language. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:speech-tempo" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

that the world as we know it is well and truly fucked. It doesn’t
matter if you’re looking at Covid response, or inaction on climate
change, or corruption, or communications surveillance: it increasingly
looks like we are being governed and managed overwhelmingly by
dunderheads just bumbling along, equipped with less than the most
basic empathy, and lacking the mental faculties required to understand
exponential growth or conditional probability or even percentages. And
people — &lt;em&gt;intelligent&lt;/em&gt; people — are seriously pondering the situation
with utter befuddlement: how the hell did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German writer &lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_Buddenbohm"&gt;Max
Buddenbohm&lt;/a&gt;
recently asked his followers a question to that effect &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Buddenbohm/status/1460124921993084929"&gt;on
Twitter&lt;/a&gt;,
which I am taking the liberty to translate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a reflected opinion on why everything is so poorly
organized, as in at its core? Historically or sociologically, what’s
the real principal reason? How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s perhaps a bit amusing and stereotypically German to complain
of &lt;span class="fraktur"&gt;ſchlechte Organiſation!&lt;/span&gt; in
the middle of a pandemic and global climate cataclysm, but the
sentiment behind the question is sound: it looks as though at every
twist and turn, those empowered to make any kind of decision make the
wrong one, or none at all, or — the worst — aren’t even able to come
up with sensible &lt;em&gt;options&lt;/em&gt; between which to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have a hypothesis: I think the issue at the core of why
everything appears to be going down the tubes is that &lt;strong&gt;we have
systematically drummed creativity out of people,&lt;/strong&gt; for at least fifty
years. And as a result, we collectively have no idea how we can get
ourselves out of a rut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me swiftly explain what I mean by “creativity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wonderful &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_(educationalist)"&gt;Sir Ken
Robinson&lt;/a&gt;,
who left us much too soon in 2020, described creativity as “the
process of having original ideas that have value.” And in arguing for
the value of creativity, we don’t need to get all hippy-touchy-feely:
creativity — and &lt;em&gt;teaching and learning&lt;/em&gt; creativity — is a simple
economic necessity that is also essential to our survival as a
species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have no idea what our world will look like ten years — or even
ten &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; — from now, then how the hell is any “hard skill” we
acquire today &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; to be useful in future challenges? The
paramount faculty we need to acquire, train, and nurture is the
ability to come up with flexible, intelligent, &lt;em&gt;creative&lt;/em&gt; solutions to
the problems we’ll encounter tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this we haven’t been doing. From an early age onwards, generation
after generation has been schooled in “the right way” to do things.
And since “the right way” exists only for things we already know, we
are now ensnared in a trap called conformity that is no good at all in
the present situation where so many of us are confronted with things we
haven’t a clue about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate what I mean, allow me to offer an anecdote from my own
personal family experience. When my son, who is now nearly an adult,
was a nine-year-old pupil in his fourth year of primary schooling, he
started to be tasked with writing little stories — it would be an
exaggeration to call them “essays” at that point — in school. And,
given the fact that he was quite an imaginative kid, the first couple
of stories he wrote were truly charming and delightful. But after a
few weeks, something strange happened: his stories were getting rather
bland and boring, and were hardly a reflection of his vivid
imagination anymore. So as his parents, we gently queried about this
mysterious phenomenon — and he was quite happy and forthcoming to
explain the reason. He had observed, he informed us, that the fellow
pupils of his that had got good marks and the teacher’s appreciation
on the first stories they had written were the ones that had turned in
the writing with the fewest spelling and grammar mistakes. And
apparently he resolved then and there to henceforth only turn in
stories that were composed of sentences strung together from words he
already knew how to spell, using constructions that he was already
familiar with — and that he was thus unlikely to stuff up. Of course
that made &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; the stories about as exciting as watching paint
dry, but it kept the teacher happy and thus, off his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can attest that this very much goes for my own schooling as
well. It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about my German classes or
English classes or French classes, “correctness” always prevailed over
originality or wit or creativity. I don’t mean to insinuate that
clever writing should get you a free pass to absolutely butcher your
spelling and grammar, but then on the other hand perfect orthography
and punctuation did always make up for abject boredom, and that’s not
quite right either. And this wasn’t restricted to just language
classes: in maths exams there was no extra credit to be had for
arriving at the correct solution of a problem in a novel or
unconventional way. Nay, such brazen nonconformity would net you
either a reprimand from the teacher for not showing the correct &lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt;
to the solution, or at least a snide remark of the “oh you think
you’re very clever don’t you, now sit down and behave” type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My English and French and German teachers appear to have been unaware
of &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; fact related to their institutional correctness
obsession. Consider this: people who actually make a living from
writing — no matter if it’s fiction or non-fiction — tend to work with
&lt;em&gt;editors,&lt;/em&gt; people whose calling it is to not only correct issues with
orthography or punctuation, but also to helpfully point out plot holes
and suggest the occasional rewrite of dialogue or rearrangement of
chapters. Editors are highly respected by writers and instrumental to
the success of a book but yet, strangely, these people’s names are
normally not printed in bold letters across the book cover, and they
also don’t appear in best seller lists. If my language teachers had
been correct, editors should be celebrity superstars! And they should
hold far greater prestige than the silly authors who only come up with
the storylines but regularly struggle with the placement of a
semicolon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the problem with the idea that errors are awful, and the fact that
that idea is being hammered into our heads from an early age, is that
this has a devastating effect on our creative imagination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being
creative. What we do know is: if you’re not prepared to be wrong,
you’ll never come up with anything original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Ken Robinson, “&lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity"&gt;Do schools kill
creativity?&lt;/a&gt;”
(2006)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you want people to be boring and dull and utterly devoid of
originality, then foster a culture where being error-free is
paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the business world, some tend to look down on others who have a
tenuous relationship with spelling and grammar and punctuation,
chiding such deficiencies as “unprofessional.” But at the same time,
it’s commonly accepted to be dragged into a meeting and then forced to
listen to someone drone on for an hour in a narcotic monologue
consisting of the recitation of thirty-four wall-of-text slides with
precisely seven bullet points each, in a ferocious assault on
everyone’s attention and consciousness that gives an overdose of
Valium a run for its money. How, pray tell, is it ever “professional”
to steal people’s precious lifetime by boring them out of their
fucking minds? And yet, this is somehow acceptable behavior in the
world of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me add another bit of anecdotal first-hand experience: a few years
ago when I was making most of my living as a travelling technical
consultant, I was often brought in to help a team of engineers chart a
path for solving a particular problem using one of the technologies I
knew a little bit about. And in doing so, some decisions frequently
boiled down to two choices, which I was always happy to lay out in
detail: here is option A, it comes with these advantages and
disadvantages, and here’s option B, it comes with &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; advantages
and disadvantages. And I would explain to my client that it is now
their &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; decision to determine whether the pros of A outweigh
the pros of B &lt;em&gt;for their business,&lt;/em&gt; and whether or not they would be
able to live with the cons of whatever option they chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And inevitably, the reactions to this nearly always fell into one of
two categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first category was gratitude for me having laid out the options
clearly and distilled the pros and cons of each, informed by my
technical expertise on the matter and my understanding of their
situation. And the business decision was either completely obvious to
them, or they appreciated having a good &lt;em&gt;basis&lt;/em&gt; on which to make a
decision, which they resolved to make in the following days or weeks,
presumably after some more empirical, experimental evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the second category was complete confusion on a person’s face,
followed by the exasperated question, “so what do you recommend?” Or,
worse, “what’s the right way?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can probably guess which category of answers was more likely to
come from managers — or “leaders”, as such people like to be called
in a &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2019/04/21/non-technical/"&gt;gross exaggeration of their
capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now imagine someone having gone through a conventional primary and
secondary education, then continued on to university and from there
into business or the law, or maybe the academic Ph.D. track, while in
parallel having risen through the ranks of that cult of rigidity and
conformism called a political party — and ultimately entering
public office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, another illustrative anecdote. Not from myself or my
family but still close to home: you may remember how early in the
Covid-19 pandemic in February 2020, the Tyrolean ski resort of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischgl#COVID-19_pandemic_hotspot"&gt;Ischgl&lt;/a&gt;
became Central Europe’s &lt;a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/ischgl-oesterreichisches-skiparadies-als-corona-hotspot/"&gt;first major infection
hotspot&lt;/a&gt;,
directly linked to at least 600 cases in Austria and more than twice
as many across Europe. (At the time, 1,800 confirmed Covid cases
seemed like a lot. As I write this, we have about 10 times as
many. &lt;em&gt;Per day.&lt;/em&gt;) The universal understanding of the majority of
observers at the time — and today — was that the situation on the
ground had been horribly botched, and that egregious mistakes were
made that greatly facilitated the spread of Covid-19 across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official in charge of public health in the provincial cabinet then
&lt;a href="https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000115833853/alles-richtig-gemacht-entlarvendes-interview-mit-tirolergesundheitslandesrat-tilg-in-der"&gt;went on national news a couple of weeks
later&lt;/a&gt;
to discuss the events. And, despite the repeated questions from the
exasperated interviewer, voiced with increasing levels of disbelief,
the official kept insisting that the authorities had “done everything
right” and were not to be faulted at all for their actions — and
inactions — in this public health emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don’t even think that this was just hubris or an attempted
cover-up. Rather, it’s a symptom of the exact problem I’m trying to
describe. If you’re applying only &lt;em&gt;what you already know&lt;/em&gt; to a
situation that’s never been here before, you’re failing horribly at
dealing with that situation. But if you’ve been conditioned that
applying “the correct solution” is all you’ll ever have to do in life
to succeed, you eventually end up genuinely believing that that’s
enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s how, in the greatest crisis that humanity has faced in
peacetime in over a century, what we’re stuck with are leaders who,
for the most part, have been so thoroughly molded by the perpetual
vicious cycle of conformism that they now operate with the
decisiveness and agility of a herd of mammoths deep-frozen in
permafrost. They are just shockingly ill-equipped to deal with a
global health crisis affecting a closely interconnected
civilization. And the ones that actually used creative ways to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt;
to power turn out to be sociopathic one-trick cronies that could not
apply their skills to something useful if their life depended on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks as though &lt;em&gt;systematically,&lt;/em&gt; those who have the &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; to
make decisions, at all levels — in business, politics, anywhere —
frequently lack the intellectual, emotional, and empathetic
&lt;strong&gt;creative&lt;/strong&gt; capabilities required to make those decisions. This is
not to say that exceptions to this rule don’t exist — I’m lucky enough
to live in a town where officials from the mayor on down have been
exceptionally creative, empathetic, &lt;em&gt;and successful&lt;/em&gt; in their Covid
response, for example — but I would argue that the rule does stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it would be entirely fair to counter my arguments with the
observation that surely, in the say 1950s or 1930s or 1910s schooling
and education were still more rigid than they are today, and certainly
did not allow for &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; creative freedom than they do now. And that
is certainly true, but there is something that children (at least
those lucky enough to &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; to school, I am aware that for those who
spent their childhood toiling in the fields or coal mines it was an
entirely different story) had during their schooling in those days
that is a precious rarity today: time and space to let their mind
play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Cleese writes in his &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50719532-creativity"&gt;excellent book on
creativity&lt;/a&gt;
that &lt;em&gt;mental play&lt;/em&gt; — the ability to let your mind wander and thereby
become open to developing new ideas — is a key element of the creative
process. And this is by no means limited to music or literature or the
arts; some of the examples he lists of mental playfulness leading to
groundbreaking new ideas are from the world of science. Now, it is
essential to be able to keep our mind in that state of playfulness for
some time, because it takes a little while for new ideas to pop into
our head. And so, Cleese observes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest killer of creativity is interruption. It pulls your
mind away from what you want to be thinking about. […] It might be
an interruption from outside, like someone coming over and talking
to you, or an email popping up in your inbox. Or it may come from
inside, as when you suddenly remember something you’ve forgotten to
do, or worry that time is running out, or that you don’t think
you’re clever enough to solve whatever problem it is you’re trying
to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— John Cleese, “Creativity: A Short and Cheerful Guide” (2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the bit that’s incredibly difficult to achieve for most
people born after about 1970, and many born earlier too. That includes
any child alive today, but also their parents and many of their
grandparents. We are &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; dealing with outside interruptions,
many of them coming from a device we carry in our pockets all day. We
have to fight for our uninterrupted mental play time. A child in the
1950s might just run off to play with friends for the afternoon, and
return home for supper. Without a text from a parent or a snapchat
message from the school bully rudely interrupting halfway
through. It’s perhaps no coincidence that some of those 1950s children
ended up being
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aaron"&gt;26-year-olds&lt;/a&gt; who could
figure out powering up a disabled spacecraft while it’s on a
free-return trajectory around the Moon, saving the life of a three-man
crew in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more evidence that even in the world of engineering, allowing
your mind to let go for a bit can lead to creative breakthroughs: &lt;a href="https://appel.nasa.gov/2010/09/20/jim-crocker-on-systems-engineering/"&gt;Jim
Crocker&lt;/a&gt;
was the Ball Aerospace engineer who solved the problem of how exactly
the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_Optics_Space_Telescope_Axial_Replacement"&gt;corrective
optics&lt;/a&gt;
on the Hubble Space Telescope should be installed — obviously not a
scenario that anyone accounted for in Hubble’s design.  The ingenious
idea that ended up saving Hubble from being a multibillion dollar
boondoggle &lt;a href="https://www.ball.com/aerospace/newsroom/features/genius-at-work"&gt;came to him in the
shower&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in offices in which we worked with maybe one other colleague in
the room, we had stretches of time where the other person was off
running an errand in town or taking a meeting in a conference
room. And you could close the door and put up a “do not disturb” sign
and do some uninterrupted thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the year 2000, most of that started to change, dramatically.
Open-plan offices, which of course were allegedly introduced to
“facilitate cooperation,” eliminated any room for uninterrupted mental
play at work. Emails replaced typed and printed memos, office workers
transitioned from workstations to laptops. Pagers and cell phones
started to buzz people at home. Around 2010 we progressed to smart
phones, tablets and other portable devices that had the ability to
ping us out of playful thought with an audible notification at any
time of day. &lt;em&gt;Knowledge work became interrupt-driven&lt;/em&gt; — a sentence
that in itself should make anyone shudder that knows anything about
knowledge work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s no surprise that people who rose to corporate leadership
after being imprinted by an interrupt-driven lifestyle — that is,
people now in their 50s — think that such a thing is &lt;em&gt;normal,&lt;/em&gt; and try
to impress the same thing on their subordinates. That’s how you get to
Slack-driven companies. That’s how you end up in a culture where
people are proud of getting back to any email within 30 minutes (or
less), and expecting the same from everyone. That’s how you end up
with managers who take being signed into a chat (and thereby
&lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; listening for interruptions) as a measure of being
“active”, so much so that they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pleia2/status/1456629767743016966"&gt;end up tracking metrics for
it&lt;/a&gt;, and of
course also &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/11/14/meaningless-metrics-treacherous-targets/"&gt;making it a
target&lt;/a&gt; they
call “engagement” or some other abomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations that do that are at risk of constantly shutting down
creativity, problem-solving, and innovation. What they’re good for is
developing efficient cookie-cutter techniques for optimizing solutions
for &lt;em&gt;yesterday’s&lt;/em&gt; issues. What we need &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; — in a global pandemic,
and in the roiling climate crisis that’ll make this pandemic look like
a walk in the park — is people and organizations equipped with the
mindset for the issues of &lt;em&gt;tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt; And a first imperative for
making that happen is to &lt;strong&gt;let people think.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is everything all doom and gloom? I’d say it isn’t, and there are
indeed some things that make me hopeful. Some of those are related to
a changed approach to creativity in education, some, to a changing
approach to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in my country as of a few years ago it is indeed such
that creativity and originality are accorded at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; merit in
marking and grading standards. And this is at the secondary school
level, traditionally one of the most rigid and unchanging branches of
education where I live. Much more still is happening at the primary
and preschool level, where I see &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more emphasis on thinking,
creative play, and innovation in my younger kids’ education than I did
in my older ones’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, there’s the big push towards asynchronous distributed work —
where obviously the &lt;em&gt;asynchronous&lt;/em&gt; part is the bit that matters. Sure,
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/23/make-my-company-distributed/"&gt;companies suffering from &lt;em&gt;offissification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
still exist, but for a while, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo"&gt;so did
dodos&lt;/a&gt;. But an ever-increasing
share of humanity is beginning to understand what it’s like when
you’re no longer shackled to seventeen Slack channels you constantly
need to watch, when you can take a walk in the middle of the day
because you know it’s OK to push something off for an hour to clear
your head and come up with an idea, and when instead of spending an
hour in a meeting &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/27/this-meeting-should-have-been-an-email/"&gt;you can spend 5 minutes reading a memo and use the
other 55 minutes for
thinking&lt;/a&gt;.  And
that’s where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="Work"></category><category term="Communications"></category></entry><entry><title>Meaningless Metrics, Treacherous Targets</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/11/14/meaningless-metrics-treacherous-targets/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2021-11-14:/blog/2021/11/14/meaningless-metrics-treacherous-targets/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick introduction to Goodhart, Strathern, Campbell, Yankelovich, and McNamara.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A common feature of organizations in the software technology industry
(but certainly not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in that industry) is their fixation on
metrics, measurements, and quantifiers. I understand that this is
frequently done and advocated for in the spirit of making management
more objective, less arbitrary, more scientific, and perhaps
fairer. But since they say that the road to hell is often paved with
good intentions, here’s a quick summary of what we know about about
the undesirable side effects of such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goodhart’s Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British economist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodhart"&gt;Charles
Goodhart&lt;/a&gt; wrote in
1975, in an article about British monetary policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once
pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Charles Goodhart, “Problems of Monetary Management: the
U.K. Experience” (1975)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a mouthful of somewhat niche technical jargon, but let me try
to paraphrase it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You collect some data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You crunch the numbers using statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You observe a pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You distill a value (a “statistical regularity”) from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone decides that that value should change: it is too high or too
  low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone — an individual or a group — is tasked with bringing that
  value up or down, and then keeping it high or low, or rising or
  falling, or above or below a particular threshold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That value now is no longer a useful statistical indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; knew as &lt;em&gt;Goodhart’s Law&lt;/em&gt; if you’d heard about it
prior to reading this article is a generalization by anthropologist
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Strathern"&gt;Marilyn Strathern&lt;/a&gt;,
also from the UK:&lt;sup id="fnref:why-goodhart"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:why-goodhart"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Marilyn Strathern, “&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/ImprovingRatingsAuditInTheBritishUniversitySystem"&gt;‘Improving ratings’: audit in the British
University
system&lt;/a&gt;”
(1997)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that so? It’s because once you make the measure a target that
has an influence on people (for example, meeting it gets them a bonus,
failing at it gets them a demotion), you have wired them to improve
&lt;em&gt;the measure,&lt;/em&gt; and not necessarily to improve the underlying
conditions that the measure originally arose from. Therefore, they
might opt for gaming the measure, because that gets them to their goal
(a promotion, for example) more quickly and at less effort to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even keeping the option of fudging the numbers aside:
when faced with a choice between doing something that might have a
negative effect on the measure and something else that might have a
negative effect on something &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; the measure, people will
tend to choose the latter. This may lead to situations where people
&lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; an activity with &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; inherent value, just to avoid
depressing a measurement — a concept known as &lt;em&gt;creaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:creaming"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:creaming"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a hospital may be interested in measuring individual
surgeons’ intraoperative death rates: the percentage of a surgeon’s
patients that die in the middle of surgery. On its face, this metric
could help weed out bad surgeons. If a particular surgeon is an
outlier and has &lt;em&gt;way more&lt;/em&gt; patients dying on their operating table
than their peers, it’s possible that that surgeon might be doing
something wrong: they could be incompetent, or frequently intoxicated,
or even be a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Death"&gt;Dr. Death&lt;/a&gt; type
serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets tricky, though, when in the interest of transparency the
hospital doesn’t just fire or retrain incompetent surgeons which it
identifies based on such statistics, but when it “publishes” the
patient mortality data. (I use quotes here because this does not
necessarily mean sharing it with the general public, but perhaps
sharing it with all of the surgical staff.) At that stage, an
individual surgeon’s &lt;em&gt;rank&lt;/em&gt; in the statistics will become at least a
matter of pride, status, and prestige, even if it’s not otherwise
rewarded in any way, nor seen as a precondition for continued
employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, then, will incentivize surgeons to &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; taking on risky
surgeries where there is a significant chance of the patient dying
mid-surgery — surgeries typically &lt;em&gt;attempted&lt;/em&gt; in the first place to
save the patient’s life, in the course of an immediate major
emergency. Thus, Dr. Alpher who only ever treats torn knee ligaments
might look better in the ranking than Dr. Bethe the polytrauma
specialist, or Dr. Gamow the neurosurgeon who specializes in
particularly challenging malignant brain tumor removal. If there is a
non-negligeable risk of intraoperative death for a particular brain
cancer patient and such an event would be bad for Dr. Gamow’s ranking,
then Dr. Gamow might have an incentive to declare that patient
inoperable — and as a result the patient would &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; die, just
not in surgery.&lt;sup id="fnref:tyranny"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tyranny"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Campbell’s Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although less well known than Goodhart’s law, Campbell’s law is
closely related and, in my humble opinion, just as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_T._Campbell"&gt;Donald
T. Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, a
U.S.-based social scientist, wrote in 1976, on the subject of
standardized testing in education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social
decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures
and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social
processes it is intended to monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achievement tests may well be valuable indicators of general school
achievement under conditions of normal teaching aimed at general
competence. But when test scores become the goal of the teaching
process, they both lose their value as indicators of educational
status and distort the educational process in undesirable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Donald T. Campbell, “Assessing the impact of planned social
change” (1976)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you conduct a one-time evaluation of student
achievement across many students in multiple schools, then the fact
that the test is standardized might help in achieving comparable
results. However, as soon as you make the tests a repeat occurrence,
and tie students’ test results to school funding allocations, teacher
salaries, or even just school prestige, you’re undermining their
original purpose: teachers will now spend a significant portion of
their time and effort to ensure that students &lt;em&gt;score well on the
test&lt;/em&gt;, rather than build the competence that the test was originally
designed to measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of allocating resources (teacher and student time
and effort) to an activity with no inherent value (taking a
standardized test) just to improve a measurement (the test score). And
since the resources are finite, spending them on the activity with no
inherent value (test-taking) makes less of them available to the
inherently valuable activity the indicator is intended to assess
(teaching and learning). This is the “corruption and distortion”
Campbell talks about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The McNamara Fallacy, and the Yankelovich Ladder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely related to Goodhart’s, Strathern’s and Campbell’s observations
is something called the McNamara Fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara"&gt;Robert McNamara&lt;/a&gt;,
U.S. Secretary of Defense during much of the Vietnam war, infamously
believed that he could scientifically measure the progress of the war
by quantitative indicators alone. One of his favourites was &lt;em&gt;body
count,&lt;/em&gt; the number of enemy personnel killed, in comparison to
friendly casualties. The rationale appears to have been, whatever
other factors (qualitative or quantitative) are in play, whichever
side kills more of the other wins the war. Indeed he seems to have
been inclined towards ignoring all non-quantitative indicators of how
the war was going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anecdote
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy#The_Vietnam_War"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt;
by U.S. Air Force general &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lansdale"&gt;Edward
Lansdale&lt;/a&gt; alleges that
he (Lansdale) pointed out to McNamara in a briefing that McNamara,
when assessing the progress of the war, failed to take into account
the feelings of the common rural Vietnamese people. McNamara then
allegedly wrote an item saying “feelings of the Vietnamese people” on
his list of things to keep track of in pencil, pondered it for a
moment, and then erased it — reasoning to Lansdale that feelings
cannot be measured, thus must not be important.&lt;sup id="fnref:lansdale"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lansdale"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is step 3 on a progressive scale social scientist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Yankelovich"&gt;Daniel
Yankelovich&lt;/a&gt;
described a few years later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This
  is OK as far as it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step is to disregard that which can’t be easily
  measured or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is
  artificial and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third step is to presume that what can’t be measured easily
  really isn’t important. This is blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth step is to say that what can’t be easily measured
  really doesn’t exist. This is suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Daniel Yankelovich, “Corporate Priorities: A continuing study of
the new demands on business” (1972).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s somewhat remarkable just how often businesses and
organizations fall into this trap, fifty years later. They might not
end up at step 4, but falling for step 2 or 3 is bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An applied example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s now turn to an example from our industry. Something that’s so
important, evidently, that it has given rise to a whole discipline in
our field: &lt;em&gt;site reliability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s perhaps a bit amusing that although you can find myriads of
articles describing what &lt;em&gt;site reliability engineering&lt;/em&gt; (SRE) is, a
definition of “site reliability” lives only in a small footnote of the
&lt;a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/preface/#id-gA2u2Iyh4"&gt;Google SRE Book&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, reliability is “The probability that [a system]
will perform a required function without failure under stated
conditions for a stated period of time”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones, Jennifer Petoff, Niall Murphy, “Site
Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems”
(2017)&lt;sup id="fnref:oconnor"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:oconnor"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, at least there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a definition, which is good. Now I think it’s
reasonable to say that the following two statements &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; site
reliability are probably true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with SRE reflecting a holistic approach to engineering,
   trying to unify a multitude of considerations, site reliability is
   not something we can judge by a single, numerical, universal, and
   useful metric. You can’t measure a single “site reliability score”,
   and then compare hundreds of platforms based on that.&lt;sup id="fnref:score"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:score"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever site reliability &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; as a whole, it certainly &lt;em&gt;includes&lt;/em&gt;
   a site’s ability to process your data and not mangle it. So, if you
   upload your data into a platform, you want to be able to do
   something useful with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SRE tends to rely on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/#indicators-o8seIAcZ"&gt;service level
indicators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
(SLIs) to measure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs),
manage error budgets, and generally keep track of what shape the
site/platform is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s compare two indicators that differ greatly in their
measurability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability&lt;/em&gt; is exceptionally easy to measure for, say, a REST
   API. You send a request with a defined payload, you measure the
   time it takes to serve your request, you check the status code, you
   check whether the response contains what you expect, and you record
   a data point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Durability&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more difficult to measure at any given point
   in time. Effectively, to properly take a data point for durability
   at the same time as getting one for availability, you’d have to
   read back some data you wrote, say, a year ago, and check its
   content against something like a known hash.&lt;sup id="fnref:hash"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hash"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;And also&lt;/em&gt; write some
   data now, travel a year into the future, read it back at that
   point, travel back into the present,&lt;sup id="fnref:timetravel"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:timetravel"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and record your
   data point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before I continue I’d like to inject another thought to the issue
of data durability: not every platform is a storage solution. In other
words, you don’t always have the option of reading your data back
verbatim. Say for example you’re feeding an inordinate number of data
points into a platform that ingests and aggregates them. You may not
even be interested in the original data some months or years down the
road, so it might be acceptable (and even necessary, as dictated by
cost concerns) to discard the original data immediately after it has
been processed. And that rules out the possibility (or necessity) to
ever read it back exactly as it went in. But you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be interested
in the statistics that you generate based on the aggregated data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now suppose there is a subtle bug in the &lt;em&gt;implementation&lt;/em&gt; of the
aggregation algorithm. As in, the algorithm itself is perfectly fine,
but there’s a flaw in the implementation. That, too, may render part
of your data unusable or outright invalid, violating data integrity
and durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the tricky part here is that availability is easy to
measure. &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/19/data_durability_statements/"&gt;Data durability
isn’t&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore,
availability lends itself to becoming a target (hello, Professor
Strathern), and durability tends to be seen as difficult to measure
and hence less important (hello, Secretary McNamara).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, if you find yourself in charge of a system that you &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt;
has started to corrupt a significant fraction of customer data, data
which customers are pouring into it at an alarming rate, what do you
do?  You’re not sure whether there’s actual corruption yet. The proper
thing to do, if it’s impossible to rule out or fix the data corruption
problem immediately,&lt;sup id="fnref:immediately"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:immediately"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is probably to stop intake, and
also ensure that no requests are served that may touch potentially
corrupted data — that is, shut the service down even before you’ve
ascertained corruption. But if you suspect that your next bonus payout
or promotion may rely on you meeting your availability goals, and you
know you’re already shaving it close with your availability error
budget, would you really be inclined to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“You can’t manage what you don’t measure”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a popular saying in management circles that takes one of the
following forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You can’t manage what you don’t measure.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You can’t manage what you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; measure.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever variant you discuss, it is commonly attributed to either
Austrian-American management thinker &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker"&gt;Peter
Drucker&lt;/a&gt;, or to American
engineer and statistician &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming"&gt;William Edwards
Deming&lt;/a&gt;. Drucker is
seen by many as highly influential in management theory, Deming
developed groundbreaking sampling techniques used on the massive scale
of the United States census. So either of them would be an authority
on management and measurement, lending high credibility to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s just a small problem: neither of them appears to ever have
said or written anything to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest that &lt;a href="https://deming.org/myth-if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-manage-it/"&gt;one of them, Deming, ever
wrote&lt;/a&gt;
was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is wrong to suppose that if you can’t measure it, you can’t
manage it — a costly myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—  W. Edwards Deming, “The New Economics for Industry, Government,
Education” (1993)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn’t notice, the point this makes is &lt;em&gt;the exact
opposite&lt;/em&gt; of the popular version of the quote. It’s so wrong that it
comes close to the corruption of the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger"&gt;Seneca&lt;/a&gt; lament, “non
vitæ sed scholæ discimus”, “we learn not for life but for school,” of
which you surely learned the inverse… in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metrics-obsessed managers often take the misquote for gospel. So much
so that they frequently see issues where a qualitative approach is
obviously necessary, and they still try to apply quantification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My standard example for this are employee satisfaction surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what leadership should be interested in learning from
those surveys is how good people feel about working in the
company. There are a number of factors that contribute to this: are
they overloaded, well utilized, or bored? Are people treating each
other with respect and kindness, or malice and contempt? Does everyone
feel that they are doing something meaningful, or do they all hate
their work and are solely in for the money? All these things are
inherently qualitative. And the company could do a great job by hiring
a person trained in sociology or psychology, who sits down with people
for confidential qualitative interviews, and then prepares a
research report with findings and recommendations that management can
act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, we have to measure. Make everyone take an online survey where
they rate everything on a scale of 1 to 5. Do you know what that is?
Exactly, step 2 on the Yankelovich ladder. Give that what can’t easily
be measured an arbitrary quantitative value — because that’s what it
is, arbitrary. People from different cultures won’t agree even on what
&lt;a href="https://measuringu.com/scales-cultural-effects/"&gt;a simple 5-step scale really
means&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And depending on &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; version of the faux quote they adhere to, a
manager may even be farther up the ladder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they say “you can’t manage what you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; measure” (with the
  translation being “I won’t concern myself with anything for which I
  don’t have quantitative data”): that’s step 3, blindness, that which
  isn’t measured isn’t important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they insist that “you can’t manage what you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; measure”
  (with the translation being “I won’t concern myself with anything
  that isn’t quantifiable”): that’s step 4 (suicide), that which isn’t
  measured doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every article and book on bad metrics ends on a positive note, giving
you suggestions for “good” metrics: for example, make them hard to
game, make sure they are defined by competent experts, ensure that
they are in line with inherent ideas of respectability and
professionalism. Honestly, I’ve yet to come across a metric that ticks
all these boxes.&lt;sup id="fnref:game"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:game"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am aware that if you are running a platform under an existing
SLA, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be running under some metrics of questionable utility
that you cannot get rid of — just because they happen to be industry
standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of expanding metrics obsession to your entire
organization by introducing ever more counterproductive metrics, I
want to propose a different approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you measure, make the &lt;em&gt;marginal&lt;/em&gt; cost of a measurement
   negligeable.&lt;sup id="fnref:marginal"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:marginal"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The cost of adding a new metric should be
   practically zero. The moment someone has to repeatedly spend time
   on collecting and compiling the data, they can’t spend that time on
   doing productive work (and Campbell says hi), so you want to avoid
   that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effectively means that all the systems you care about
   (machines, services, applications) should generate collectable data
   points, everywhere, all the time.&lt;sup id="fnref:privacy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:privacy"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And you probably won’t be
   collecting metrics from anything else. In other words, you are
   &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; measuring that which is easily measurable, and you keep
   aware that there a lot of things you don’t measure that are just as
   important. You stay on step one of the Yankelovich ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’d propose you make the data thus ingested available throughout
   your organization, in machine-readable form and using standardized
   APIs. You want people to actually &lt;em&gt;discover&lt;/em&gt; things from your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage people to use real, scientific, statistical methods to
   figure out statistical regularities (“indicators”). Offer
   statistics training to people who are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once someone identifies a statistical regularity, encourage them to
   form an opinion of whether it would be beneficial for it to go up
   or down, formulate a hypothesis on what change to your system would
   have the desired effect, and conduct an experiment. If the
   experiment has no effect, roll back the change and proceed with the
   next hypothesis. If it has an adverse effect, roll back and try the
   opposite. If it has the desired effect, keep the change. Move on to
   discovering the next regularity. Resist the urge to make the
   discovery a target. (Otherwise, Strathern will drop
   by.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantly observe and identify things that are important, but not
   measurable. Apply qualitative analysis, emotion, and
   empathy. (Otherwise, McNamara will introduce himself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is there anything inherently wrong with measuring or measurements?
Nope. But making them targets, introducing arbitrary quantifiers, and
ignoring everything else is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:why-goodhart"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason the condensed version is called
“Goodhart’s Law” and not “Strathern’s Law” is apparently due to a
coinage by British researcher Keith Hoskin, who wrote a year prior
to Strathern, in a paper she cited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Goodhart’s Law” — that every measure which becomes a target becomes
a bad measure — is inexorably, if ruefully, becoming recognized as
one of the overriding laws of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Keith Hoskin, “The ‘awful idea of accountability’: inscribing
people into the measurement of objects” (1996)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:why-goodhart" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:creaming"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that term sounds a bit odd, I’d agree. I
guess it comes from the idea of milking a cow and then skimming
only the cream, discarding the rest. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:creaming" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:tyranny"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgery statistics example of creaming is paraphrased
from Jerry Z. Muller, “&lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691174952/the-tyranny-of-metrics"&gt;The Tyranny of
Metrics&lt;/a&gt;”
(2018). &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:tyranny" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:lansdale"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lansdale/McNamara anecdote is paraphrased from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy"&gt;the
Wikipedia article on the McNamara
Fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, which in
turn cites Rufus Phillips and Richard Holbrooke, “Why Vietnam
Matters: An Eyewitness Account of Lessons Not Learned” (2008) as
its source. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:lansdale" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:oconnor"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the SRE book is itself quoting a
definition of reliability found in Patrick P. O’Connor &amp;amp; Andre
Kleyner, “Practical Reliability Engineering” (2012). &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:oconnor" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:score"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is not lost on me that by the definition quoted in
the SRE book, such a score absolutely &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; exist if its
definition of reliability were adequate: it claims to be a
probability. Probabilities go from 0 to 1. That would make site
reliability a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1, end of
story. But it goes without saying that such a score would be “an
arbitrary quantitative value”, which would put it on step 2 of the
Yankelovich ladder. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:score" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:hash"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That hash would have to be separately stored &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the
system. If the hash is stored &lt;em&gt;alongside&lt;/em&gt; the data whose
integrity it’s meant to protect, then it only guards against
unintentional data corruption, but not against deliberate
manipulation. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hash" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:timetravel"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to point out that the only bit that’s impossible
here is the backwards time travel. The forwards time travel is
fine, we all travel forwards in time all the time, just at a
constant rate of one second per second. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:timetravel" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:immediately"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve run into a few issues of suspected silent data
corruption in my career and I’ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been in the situation
where a reliable fix was available immediately. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:immediately" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:game"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, pretty much any real-world metric fails the
“hard to game” test. Said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lukasgrossar/status/1267830321057107969"&gt;Lukas Grossar on
Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:
“It always amazes me that people don’t believe that slapping a KPI
onto something won’t lead to people gaming that KPI. We’re
engineers for God sake, making broken stuff work in our favor is
basically our job description.” &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:game" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:privacy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that this requires strong privacy guarantees for
your users/customers. Effectively, just don’t collect data that’s
none of your business. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:privacy" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:marginal"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasis on marginal. It’s obvious that the &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt;
cost of building and maintaining an instrumentation platform and
metric system is nonzero. But once you’ve got it set up, the cost
of &lt;em&gt;adding a new metric&lt;/em&gt; should be substantially zero. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:marginal" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You can’t avoid it, you can’t work around it, but you can deal with it with two simple changes to your communicative behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People skeptical of distributed, asynchronous, written communications
sometimes make they understandable objection that it is often
difficult to interpret the reactions, specifically the &lt;em&gt;absence of&lt;/em&gt;
reactions, to written online communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning goes like this: if you inform someone of something in a
face-to-face conversation, there is practically no way for them &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
to provide some sort of feedback. Even if the recipient of a verbal
message doesn’t say a word, they usually exhibit some unconscious,
nonverbal reaction, which can carry a whole load of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person might smile, light up, and become actively engaged,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they might express surprise (pleasant or unpleasant),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they may show signs of dismay or annoyance, or even anger,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they might just stare or wander off, indicating disconnection or
  indifference,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or anything in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In online, textual communications, people obviously &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; exhibit all
those reactions, sitting at their desk, lounging on their couch,
walking with their phone — it’s just that the sender of the message
usually never gets to see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a face-to-face conversation is a one-to-one communication
mode that we direct our undivided attention to. In contrast, textual
online communications are often many-to-many, and we usually get many
more parallel inputs than we do when we’re speaking to a colleague or
acquaintance or friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that while in a face-to-face conversation we’re &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;
answering, or at least showing our reaction to what was said, in online
textual communications we must &lt;em&gt;pick and choose&lt;/em&gt; what to react to, and
what to just absorb without providing any kind of feedback to the
message sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warnock’s Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In online communities this has been known since at least 2000, when
Bryan Warnock
&lt;a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/2000/08/msg1127.html"&gt;formulated&lt;/a&gt;
it as “the ostrich theory”, although it eventually &lt;a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2001/02/msg2562.html"&gt;was
named&lt;/a&gt;
“Warnock’s Dilemma”&lt;sup id="fnref:pentalemma"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:pentalemma"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by Dave Mitchell. Writing about
mailing list posts without replies, Bryan wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with no response is that there are five possible
interpretations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The post is correct, well-written information that needs no
follow-up commentary.  There’s nothing more to say except “Yeah,
what he said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The post is complete and utter nonsense, and no one wants to
waste the energy or bandwidth to even point this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) No one read the post, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) No one understood the post, but won’t ask for clarification, for
whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) No one cares about the post, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Bryan Warnock, “&lt;a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/2000/08/msg1127.html"&gt;Re: RFCs: two proposals for
change&lt;/a&gt;”,
perl.bootstrap mailing list, 2000-08-07&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In asynchronous and distributed work communications, we have much the
same issue. The beautifully crafted &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/27/this-meeting-should-have-been-an-email/"&gt;five-paragraph
briefing&lt;/a&gt; that
you sent out this morning may have been considered manna from heaven
by your recipients (if you’re a manager, your recipients are usually
your direct reports), and they immediately sprung into action
energized by your electrifying leadership. Or maybe nobody understood
a word of the unintelligible drivel you concocted, but out of respect
or courtesy they are very hesitant to point this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in my humble opinion, there are two very simple things you can do
as a manager to address Warnock’s Dilemma in your distributed team:
making it a habit to specifically encourage objections, and
establishing a culture of acknowledgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Encouraging objections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habit I have developed to encourage objections is to not merely
ask the recipients of a message to raise questions if they have them,
but to ask them to poke holes in whatever I’ve been writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I have standing phrases that I use, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do you think that sounds reasonable?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Did I overlook something important?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Can you think of a better way to do this?” (Better than my
  suggestion, that is.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I’m pretty sure I’m missing something here, can you pitch in?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Am I way out in left field with this?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“How nuts of an idea is this?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might use a variation on one or several of these phrases at the end
of an email, but also in the comments section of a wiki page (or in
individual inline comments), or even in the reply thread of an issue
tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This serves multiple purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many individual areas of knowledge where someone on my
   team is more of an expert than I am. Obviously, I want those
   people’s ideas on the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It establishes the notion that nobody’s opinions or suggestions on
   technical matters are sacrosanct, and we want to do &lt;em&gt;the right
   thing&lt;/em&gt; in any situation, not follow the hippo.&lt;sup id="fnref:hippo"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hippo"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It encourages others to ask for feedback in the same manner,
   whenever they float ideas or suggestions of their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It establishes that there’s nothing wrong with being wrong from
   time to time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, on to acknowledgements, that is, what to do when you have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;
objections on something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a general rule that I use: &lt;strong&gt;all communications should be
acknowledged.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, really. Anything my team sends me, I try to reply
to with at least “ack” or “OK”, but frequently it’s something like
“great, thanks!” — it costs nothing to be kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, for everything I send &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; my team I can count on getting
the same kind of reply back. There’s something I need to pass on from
higher up? Or just something I want everyone to know? Out goes an
email, in come a few “ack” replies over the next few hours. I don’t
even have to specifically ask anyone for acknowledgement anymore, it
just happens.&lt;sup id="fnref:guidelines"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:guidelines"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, we deliberately use &lt;em&gt;written&lt;/em&gt; acknowledgements — as
in, somebody actually &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; something, even if it’s just the two
letters “OK”. I find Like buttons or thumbs-up or email “read
receipts” (anyone remember those?) oddly perfunctory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a nice side effect, in combination with encouraging
objections: someone who — while knowing that objections are always
encouraged — acknowledges an idea, opinion, or plan, &lt;em&gt;actually makes
it clear that they are on board with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:pentalemma"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To his credit, Dave points out in the same
message that “dilemma” is technically inappropriate as the problem
described includes five choices, not two. It’s properly a
&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pentalemma"&gt;pentalemma&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:pentalemma" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:hippo"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiPPO: the Highest-Paid Person’s Opinion. Following the
hippo is when you value ideas and opinions by seniority of their
originator, not by correctness or factual merit. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hippo" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:guidelines"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also codified this in my team’s communications
guidelines. You don’t have something like that? Write them. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:guidelines" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

technology or knowledge based organization (and probably others, too)
that goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meeting should have been an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s such a well-established meme at this point that you &lt;a href="https://www.redbubble.com/shop/i+survived+another+meeting+that+should+have+been+an+email+mugs"&gt;can buy mugs
saying
so&lt;/a&gt;. Or
&lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/737148259/i-survived-another-meeting-that-could"&gt;cross-stitched “award
certificates”&lt;/a&gt;,
or
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/8z31wz/office_participation/"&gt;ribbons&lt;/a&gt;. And
yet, many of you appear to dismiss it as a nerdy joke, and refuse to
take the sentiment behind it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this even though you may &lt;em&gt;agree&lt;/em&gt; that your organization has too
many meetings.  Even that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are in too many meetings. But you’re
convinced that sadly, sadly you can’t cancel &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; meeting. Or that
one. Or the quarterly financials update. Or the update about the
shakeup in the CTO office. Or the meeting explaining at &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; level
what the CEO just communicated to everyone via a video message or an
email of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do it. I’m here to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Email” means any structured, written communication that allows for feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s set one thing straight to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standing phrase is “this meeting should have been an email”
because that’s catchy. But that’s not to say that you actually need to
write an email message. What it really means is that to communicate
whatever it is that you’re trying to get across, you use a medium that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uses written expression,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows you to formulate complex thoughts and reasoning in writing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows people to comment and share feedback, in writing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ideally allows for that feedback to subsequently be worked back into
   the original writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll see that particularly considering item #4, email isn’t even the
best option available at your disposal. Instead, you can look at the
following, additional options, all of which will probably be available
to you in some form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a shared flow-text document, like a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310248?hl=en#6.3"&gt;Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;, a collaboratively edited
  &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/collaborate-on-word-documents-with-real-time-co-authoring-7dd3040c-3f30-4fdd-bab0-8586492a1f1d"&gt;Office 365 Word
  document&lt;/a&gt;,
  or a &lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-introduces-collaborative-rich-text-editor/"&gt;Nextcloud
  Text&lt;/a&gt;
  document,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a page in your organization’s wiki, like
  &lt;a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; or
  &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence"&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or even a barebones shared text editor, like
  &lt;a href="https://etherpad.org/"&gt;Etherpad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all of these are good.&lt;sup id="fnref:chat"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:chat"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; All of them are better than a meeting. With
near certainty at least one of them is available at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meetings burn people’s time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings are gigantic time consumers. And the productivity gains from
switching to well-structured written communications are &lt;strong&gt;enormous&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, allow me to offer some first-hand experience. When I’m
being called to attend a meeting, my colleagues will attest to the
fact that I am a meticulous note-taker. I write meetings up in our
corporate wiki, and I record notes, rather than producing a verbatim
transcript. But I can guarantee you that I will write down every point
that the attendees make that’s worth remembering or referring back
to. This includes some key points that I do record word-for-word. I’ve
been in meetings with 20 attendees of 1 hour in length. My meeting
notes &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go over 2,000 words for such a meeting, and usually
they’re more like 1,000 words. So that means that for a meeting that
burns 20 person-hours &lt;em&gt;just to attend&lt;/em&gt; (that is, not including meeting
prep), what actually gets said can be summarized in 2,000 words, tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, consider that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X19300786"&gt;the average silent reading rate for English
speakers&lt;/a&gt;
is approximately 240 words per minute. So people can read a 2,000-word
summary in under 9 minutes, a 1,000 word one in about 4. In other
words, by conveying the information in writing rather than orally, you
can eliminate five-sixths to fourteen-fifteenths of that useless
overhead. Or put differently, &lt;strong&gt;replacing an hourlong meeting with a
well-written briefing gives each and every person 6 to 15 times more
productivity.&lt;/strong&gt; And that’s not even counting the benefits of
eliminating the meeting as a forced synchronization point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But writing things up means more work for me!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may argue that although you understand that putting together a
well-written briefing (instead of calling a meeting) saves everyone
&lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; time, it takes up more of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me observe this: If you’ve been convening and chairing meetings of
an hour, and you haven’t been spending &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; as much time preparing
for that meeting yourself, then I’m sorry to break it you but you may
not have been a very conscientious meeting chair all along. In fact,
you may have be been rather disrespectful of other people’s time, and
now is a very good time for you to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If however you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been a conscientious meeting chair and every
one-hour meeting did, in aggregate, consume about one hour of meeting
prep (including scheduling, collecting information, and preparing it
so you have it all ready to go), then rejoice: the onerous
scheduling-and-roping-everyone-in bit is gone, so that saves up a
sizable chunk of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; time, and you can punch out 1,000 to 2,000
words in 30-45 minutes. So, &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; work for you. Admittedly, not as
dramatically so for you (the writer) as for your erstwhile attendees
(now readers), but still pretty substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not to mention the fact that &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; productivity gains in the
order-of-magnitude range, see above, should make your heart jump with
joy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OK but how? I don’t know where to start!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/"&gt;I’ve written about this
before&lt;/a&gt;, but I’d
like to come back to this again: if you’re looking for guidelines on
structuring your writing for what you would otherwise communicate in
your meetings, look at the 5-paragraph briefing format, adapted from
the NATO &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_paragraph_order"&gt;5-paragraph field
order&lt;/a&gt;. If you
make it your habit to at least &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about this format, chances are
that your briefing will be pretty damn comprehensive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break these down in a little detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation is about what position we’re in, and &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; we set out
   to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three
   sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your
   own company, any extra help that is available, and the current
   market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective is &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; we want to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan is &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; we want to achieve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logistics is about what budget and resources are available, and how
   we can use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communications is about how we’ll be coordinating among ourselves
   and with others in order to achieve our goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want to give not a full briefing, but a simple update,
such as because circumstances have changed. In that case, you may only
include the first three items, and the changes that apply to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good practice to &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; include these three (that is,
situation, objective, and plan): to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; it may be clear and obvious
that since the situation has changed, a slight modification of the
plan (or the objective!) is necessary. To others, it might not. So
just always include the current situation, the current objectives, and
the current plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also apply this to a problem statement, where it’s just as
useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what we’re currently dealing with, and how I see it (that’s
   the &lt;em&gt;situation&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here’s why it’s a problem, and why it needs to be fixed (that’s an
   &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is my suggestion for how it could be fixed (that’s a &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And finally, some poetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as my final writing tip for improving communications and
eliminating needless meetings, I want to leave you with some
poetry. These lines that just so happen to serve as a perfect mnemonic
for professional briefings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep six honest serving-men:&lt;br/&gt;
(They taught me all I knew)&lt;br/&gt;
Their names are What and Where and When&lt;br/&gt;
And How and Why and Who.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Rudyard Kipling, The Elephant’s Child, 1902&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strive for all your professional writing to answer most or all of
&lt;em&gt;what,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;where,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;when,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;how,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;why,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;who,&lt;/em&gt; and watch your need
for meetings evaporate like morning dew in glistening sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

of a functional distributed team, let’s zoom out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss a slightly larger, organizational picture, just in case
you ask yourself this question: “&lt;strong&gt;Why isn’t my organization
distributed and asynchronous?&lt;/strong&gt; And, as companies &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28833394"&gt;bleed talent right
and left&lt;/a&gt; because
competent people run for the competition that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get distributed
work right, why don’t they wake up and &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; like that?  &lt;strong&gt;Can
someone please make my company more distributed and asynchronous?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional context, let me interject the following observations
from &lt;a href="https://blog.koehntopp.info/"&gt;Kris Köhntopp&lt;/a&gt;, who posted them
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1451497494303711234"&gt;in German on
Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (I am
taking the liberty to translate here; emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s funny is that [what matters to being successful as a
distributed company] are all learnable skills — written
communications, sensible meeting prep and follow-up, correct
definition of objectives and tasks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a craft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it appears that organizations prefer to bleed their teams dry by
attrition, rather than to learn, or to hire people that can help
teams to write things down, professionally maintain a wiki, and
teach and drive communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1451508098779258889"&gt;further
downthread&lt;/a&gt;,
Kris says (again, my translation and emphasis):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all definitely feasible, after all there’s remote-first
companies of substantial size and they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They must have &lt;strong&gt;built&lt;/strong&gt; themselves somehow, they didn’t get to
where they are by pure chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with all of that (obviously), but things are complicated. So
let’s drill into this a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building is easy. Changing is hard.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve founded and bootstrapped a distributed company, and I’ve also
been involved in making a localized company more distributed. Take my
word for it: founding was daunting and scary and stressful, but in
terms of shaping structure and communications — even if you have to
figure it out as you go, as I did with my cofounders&lt;sup id="fnref:invent"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:invent"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — it’s &lt;em&gt;easy.&lt;/em&gt;
Changing the communication structure of an established company is
&lt;em&gt;hard.&lt;/em&gt; And slow. Even if you have full support from the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re in an organization that wasn’t distributed from the
get-go, do not compare it to one that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, do not compare it to one that is two years ahead of yours in
reshaping itself in a distributed and asynchronous manner. Also, if
your company went distributed kicking and screaming at the start of
the pandemic, do not compare it to one where the top leadership made a
conscious decision to be more “remote friendly” or “remote first” or
whatever their preferred term is, long before the pandemic hit. These
organizations are ahead of yours. Their change may be happening just
as slowly as yours, they just started the race earlier and are a
couple of laps ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your company hasn’t even &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; the change to distributed and
async work? You spent the last nearly two years in unfettered meeting
hell?  Your bosses think you’ll now go “back to normal”, because an
office is the only “normal” they know? &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/01/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-employees/"&gt;You know what to
do.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiring people to help: aye, there’s the rub.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on to the idea of hiring people to help. There’s two ways to look
at that: hiring people as employed &lt;strong&gt;managers&lt;/strong&gt; to work and lead in
the organization in a distributed and async fashion, or hiring people
as management &lt;strong&gt;consultants&lt;/strong&gt; to guide and advise the company in the
distributed and async transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Please note: the idea of hiring only &lt;em&gt;regular employees&lt;/em&gt; that drive a
distributed and async change “from within” — against the resistance or
inertia of established management — is ludicrous, unethical, and
unworkable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hiring distie managers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make it a priority to hire managers geared toward distributed and
asynchronous work, then if they’re worth their salt I can guarantee you
that one of the first things that they’ll ask in their first interview
is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; line manager’s (director’s, VP’s, etc) distributed and
async work experience? How about my lateral peers’?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if the truthful answer is “they’re new to this,” it’s quite likely
that your prospective new management colleague will politely end the
conversation. Their skills are in high demand; they have plenty of
options to go elsewhere. Why should sign they up for a job that’s
going to come with a ton of needless friction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, that consideration applies in all management positions,
all the way to the top. So for this to work, in an organization
currently hellbent on localized-synchronized work (I use
&lt;em&gt;offissification&lt;/em&gt; for that state of affairs), it would need at least
its entire
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_title#Senior_management"&gt;C-suite&lt;/a&gt;
to come around first. And it would then &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; need to replace at
least one-third of its current managers at all levels, to have any
chance of attracting fresh blood in management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that this isn’t exactly easy to do, plus it’ll probably
take longer than you have the patience to put up with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hiring management consultants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that leaves the option of hiring people that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of the
organization but are brought in to advise, ideally on all management
levels. These people are called management consultants. And you should
understand that they are commonly &lt;em&gt;loathed&lt;/em&gt; by mid-level line
managers. But let’s leave that aside for now. Let’s assume that you
want to consider the possibility of a management consultant whose
communication skills and empathy and talent are so outstanding that
they are absolutely not hated by anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, please put yourself in that consultant’s shoes. Before they get
anywhere near you, they would have spent countless hours in — you
guessed it — &lt;em&gt;meetings&lt;/em&gt; with the CEO, with top-level management,
possibly with department heads, to get &lt;em&gt;buy-in&lt;/em&gt;. And then, they embark
on a multi-month project where they must use the style of work
currently prevalent in your company, because that’s the only way to
even approach people. So they spend more time in — are you with me —
&lt;em&gt;meetings&lt;/em&gt; to convince and educate people. Oh, and they probably need
to bill by the day or by the hour, in some arbitrary increment that
your bean counters dictate, because otherwise they can’t get
paid. Async work, on your own time and schedule, much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that means that under most circumstances, such a project will
either involve a person who’s actually perfectly fine with localized
and synchronous work, and for this kind of project that’s &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt;
not a person you’d want to hire. Or else they’re miserably
unproductive throughout the project, and that doesn’t exactly bode
well for their health &lt;em&gt;nor&lt;/em&gt; your project. (Which means a person
understanding this probably will never start such a consultancy in the
first place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I want to mention that I suppose from the perspective of a
consultant, there is one way to square this circle: charge exorbitant
rates. If you can make a killing working two days a month, and you
actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; work just two days of meeting hell per month and take
the rest of your time off to recuperate, then that might actually
work. But then it’s less likely — not impossible, but less likely —
that your company will retain their services. Because unlike a
consultant that you bring in to chop heads, monetary gains (that is,
return on investment for the consultant’s fees) are much more
difficult to put in numbers when you’re “only” making everyone’s life
better, and attracting better employees, increasing productivity,
building better products, attracting more customers, and hence making
a bigger profit are mere knock-on effects from that.&lt;sup id="fnref:rational"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rational"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, how do things change, then?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s my rather firm belief that these things change by evolution, not
on an organizational scale but on one of market and society. &lt;strong&gt;Many of
the companies still stuck in the office mindset will not change,&lt;/strong&gt; at
least not dramatically. They will continue to bleed talent, not
attract much fresh blood, and face fierce competition from companies
that do better and attract good people. Some will undergo a slow and
sometimes painful transition and some will succeed at it. Some will
fail and go under, or become irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But expecting dramatic, sudden change at a large organization is just
not realistic. And if you’re stuck in one that’s still pretending that
this’ll all blow over, your best option is probably to make a change
for yourself, than to try to wait for one in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:invent"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that we &lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; anything, just that
we had to figure out how to make things work for ourselves that
already worked for others. Distributed
companies existed well before my cofounders and I started a
company in 2011. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB"&gt;MySQL
AB&lt;/a&gt; (incidentally, Kris
Köhntopp’s former employer) established those practices in the
2000-2005 time frame. There is an excellent &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2xmEgtRhw7o"&gt;November 2011
talk&lt;/a&gt; from ex-MySQL CEO Mårten
Mickos, in which he runs through the entire history of MySQL as an
independent company, until its acquisition by Sun in 2008. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2xmEgtRhw7o?t=1653"&gt;Around
the 27-minute mark&lt;/a&gt;, he
starts talking about work in a distributed company. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:invent" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:rational"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; there is a demonstrable expected positive
&lt;em&gt;monetary&lt;/em&gt; effect, meaning in terms of numbers it’s an absolute
no-brainer, you should consider that top management &lt;em&gt;are people,&lt;/em&gt;
and people don’t always act rationally. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rational" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

This article is on what you can do if you are stuck in meeting hell as a top-level executive, such as a CEO, Managing Director, or Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please have a look at the
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/09/30/getting-out-of-meeting-hell/"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; for
background, for applicable disclaimers, and for information about
the specific environments this series talks about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of this series is for you if you are a chief executive
officer, a managing director, executive director, or whatever else the
top-level role in your organization may be. This means that you have
people who report to you, but you don’t report to anyone in the
day-to-day operations of the company — even though you may, of course,
be answerable to your board of directors or your investors, or some
oversight body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you realize that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lot of your company spends a lot of time in useless meetings,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they’re often forced to sit through 90 minutes of staring into
  cameras when they could instead have spent 5 minutes reading an email,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people’s productivity suffers badly because they are constantly
  being interrupted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is badly affecting you, personally, as well. So for the
benefit of yourself and everyone else in the organization, you want to
change things toward being less interrupt-driven, less synchronous,
more productive, and healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve got &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; bad news for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contrast to your employees at any level, it is much harder for
   you to pull the &lt;em&gt;Leave&lt;/em&gt; option than it is for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contrast to most of your mid-level managers, no matter how hard
   you try, you may &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; escape being in a lot of meetings, and
   being in a lot of &lt;em&gt;unpleasant&lt;/em&gt; meetings to boot. Chances are, whenever
   stuff is exploding, boiling up, or otherwise going bonkers, you’ll
   be roped in to calm things down, make a decision, or soothe a
   high-profile customer who is conniptiously trying to convince you
   that your SLA is akin to the Constitution and that an engineer
   guilty of causing a violation ought to hang for treason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and this is the good news to balance the bad, if you manage to
pull the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of the company out of meeting hell, life is going to
get way better for &lt;em&gt;you,&lt;/em&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, obviously, there’ll be a lot for you to &lt;strong&gt;Learn&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’ve never
led an organization that was distributed and asynchronous by default,
there’s a lot to unpack, understand, and overcome when it comes to
turning one that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt;, into one that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your most important role at the top of the organization is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lead.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by that I mean lead by example, and also lead by policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways you can lead by example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write. Particularly when you want to communicate something to the
  whole company. All-hands video streams? &lt;em&gt;[stage whisper]&lt;/em&gt; Everyone
  hates those. Meeting invites saying “we’ll anounce something
  important”? Just write an email &lt;em&gt;saying the important thing,&lt;/em&gt; and
  then ask people to send you questions by a deadline. And publicly
  commit &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; to a deadline by which they can expect answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take no shortcuts. If you’re setting up communications rules for
  everyone, live by them yourself. &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/09/16/rules-are-rules/"&gt;There’s a bad, hidden cost in
  skirting around them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a point of always giving context when pinging someone in chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quit calling people without warning — you can’t convey the &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;
  of the call without them answering. A cold call is the ultimate
  &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings"&gt;naked ping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, cut back on synchronous, realtime communications. They
  always interrupt people, and &lt;a href="https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/"&gt;interruptions are
  expensive&lt;/a&gt;. Think
  about how much money you’ll lose from someone &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; having a
  brilliant idea because you pinged them about some technicality in
  the company chat while they were deeply immersed in a complex
  problem. (Also, think about how much money you might &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; already
  lost that way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insist on agendas being drawn up and meeting notes being kept (and
  both &lt;em&gt;circulated&lt;/em&gt; to anyone who needs the information) for every
  meeting you are asked to attend. Write an agenda for every meeting
  you call or chair. If you have a group that meets regularly, appoint a
  different person from the group as a scribe each time. Do not ask a
  person to volunteer. (If you do, chances are that one person in the
  group will be typecast as the scribe for all such meetings. I call
  such an unfortunate person a &lt;em&gt;scrapegoat.&lt;/em&gt; You don’t want
  scrapegoats.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, here are ways you can lead by policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hire professional writers. (In the software industry, tech writers
  come to mind.) Not because you want &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; people to be
  scrapegoats, but because professional writers can massively move
  your organization forward in efficiency of written expression,
  document organization, and clarity of communications. Make them a
  hiring priority. Pay them handsomely — good tech writers can make
  good money freelancing; you’ll need to make them a pretty compelling
  offer to consider giving up some of that freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ram a stake in the ground making clear to everyone you will not
  tolerate corporate surveillance or invasions of privacy. Any attempt
  to introduce an “always on camera” policy should be grounds for
  reprimanding the manager that instigated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insist on the procurement of tools that take distributed,
  asynchronous work into account. A video conferencing system that
  values surveillance over privacy is not one your company should
  throw money at. A hiring platform that requires specifying an
  “office location” for every role, and has no provisions for remote
  positions, isn’t either. Neither is a chat platform hosted by a
  company whose sole chance at long-term success is to pull &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;
  corporate communications into synchronous chat. Yes, these judgments
  require technical expertise. If this is something you don’t have
  because you consider yourself a “non-technical” person, &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2019/04/21/non-technical/"&gt;I have
  something to read for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another thing that you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be inclined toward doing:
declaring meeting-free days, as in making it a policy that no meetings
are to be scheduled on Wednesdays. I think of that as very much a
stop-gap measure that’s often done out of sheer despair. Sure, you
want your people to have meeting-free days, but you actually want them
to have &lt;em&gt;meeting days,&lt;/em&gt; with meetingless days being the norm, rather
than the exception. I think you’re better off gradually replacing your
meeting-addicted managers with ones that are accustomed to distributed
and asynchronous work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this may be a bitter pill to swallow: getting to
distributed and asynchronous is infinitely harder if you have built a
“flat” organization. If every one of your managers has 20-30 direct
reports, they will feel utterly overwhelmed at the thought of staying
in asynchronous communication with every one of them, not to mention
the fact that it’s damn near impossible for them to convince that many
people at one time to adopt a new way of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the many, many ways in which &lt;a href="https://getlighthouse.com/blog/flat-organizational-structure-fails/"&gt;flat organizations fail
to
scale&lt;/a&gt;,
but this gives you the opportunity to fix two issues at the same
time. If you’ve got one manager that’s actively promoting meeting hell
that is currently making life miserable for 20 people, you can split
that team up into 4, and hire 3 team leads that know how to work
asynchronously and distributed (or promote people who have that sort
of experience and want to step up). Then, in the one remaining team
with the unreformed meeting addict, things can go three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one “traditional” team sees how things go in the other teams,
  and they quickly coax their team lead into doing things the new way, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they all ask to be transferred, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(the worst-case scenario) the one meeting-addicted manager continues
  to annoy everyone, and they all leave. That’s bad, and a failure of
  judgment (that manager should probably have been let go first), but
  losing 4 good people, as difficult as that might be, is probably
  “better” than losing 20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final thought, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; take a moment to put yourself in other
people’s shoes, and understand what options &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; have with being
stuck in meeting hell. Whether it’s your &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/02/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-managers/"&gt;line
managers&lt;/a&gt; or your
regular
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/01/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-employees/"&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt;, they
both have the option to just chuck in their notice and leave, and
leave they will, if they’re sufficiently deep in meeting hell. They
have plenty of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lead by example, and lead by policy. Do things right, but more
importantly do the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article concludes the series — for now. I am guessing that
people reading this will have opinions, air their grievances, and
share feedback. Those usually give me good thinking material to
dwell on, so I’ll probably have an additional installment based on
reader feedback at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please have a look at the
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/09/30/getting-out-of-meeting-hell/"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; for
background, for applicable disclaimers, and for information about
the specific environments this series talks about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of this series is for you if you are a manager at any level
of your organization &lt;em&gt;except the very top.&lt;/em&gt; In other words, you have
reports, but you also report to someone. And as such you may be stuck
in meeting hell in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With your own team, that is to say, yourself and the people
   reporting to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With your management peers, in other words, the people that manage
   other teams and report to the same director, VP, or whatever other
   fancy titles your company might use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ll cover both of those angles, but before I do, I should note
that you, of course, have one option to improve your personal
situation that is &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/01/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-employees/"&gt;also available to your
reports&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;strong&gt;Leave.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not the only option you have, and it may not be your
&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; option, but an option it is. And, for your personal
development, taking on a management role in a company that does
distributed work and asynchronous communications right might be an
excellent career move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a conscientious manager and you feel a sense of
responsibility and obligation to your team, and this makes you
hesitate to consider the option to leave, then that reflects nobly on
your character but know this: that responsibility is contigent on
everyone’s employment in one organization, and it ends the day your
employment contract (or theirs) terminates. That may sound harsh, but
that’s the breaks of the game, and you shouldn’t let that hold you up,
if leaving is the objectively most sensible option for you. There’s no
use burning out over an exaggerated sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I’d posit that you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; leave your company if it
employs or promotes employee surveillance, keeps voodoo “meeting
engagement metrics”, or engages in otherwise harmful or toxic
behavior. I’d argue that in those cases you should also make sure your
direct reports know why you’re leaving, to the extent that your
contractual obligations allow you to tell them.&lt;sup id="fnref:non-disparagement"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:non-disparagement"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’ve chosen &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to leave your current organization,
and you want to actually do the hard work for making work
&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; for yourself and your distributed team, here is your
paramount obligation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything that the coronavirus pandemic has shown about
organizations making the (admittedly abrupt) transition from localized
to distributed work, it’s this: it’s a challenge for managers much
more than for non-manager employees. You have to make a conscious
effort to learn how distributed work works, and how you manage a
distributed team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, chances are that you won’t be limited to watching talks or
listening to podcasts or reading articles (you might have &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/"&gt;read this
one&lt;/a&gt; before you
landed here). Instead, it’s not unlikely that if you’re doing software
or technology development, some of the people on your team are already
well versed in distributed collaboration and asynchronous
communications. Yes, I am of course talking about open source
contributors. It absolutely does not matter &lt;em&gt;what kind&lt;/em&gt; of open source
software some on your team have worked or helped out on, or whether
it’s in any way related to the products your company builds. Everyone
who’s ever landed a pull request probably has had to learn more about
distributed, async communications than any office dweller did who
never has. Find those people. Talk to them. Learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll also have peers in the industry, outside your company. Managers
who’ve already done the work. They can’t do the &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; for you,
but they can you show a few tricks of the trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ll give you one, straight away: in a company stuck in Meeting
Hell, you change things for your team first, and don’t even think
about people at or above your level.  I would not advise taking your
ideas up the chain without the confidence of knowing that what you are
suggesting works in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; team. Mid-level management is unfortunately
often full of “great idea, but it’ll never work here” or “that might
sound nice, but I’m afraid it doesn’t fit our culture.” You want to
run silent, run deep (if you permit me a strained metaphor). When your
team lands its first great big success, &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; when you casually
want to drop something like “we did this on one meeting a week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can you get there? Here are a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliminate daily standups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limit yourself to one scheduled team meeting a week. Keep it to
  approximately one hour, give or take a few minutes. Schedule it near
  the start of the work week (meaning, in most countries, on Monday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have an agenda for your team meeting (and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; other meetings) that
  is available in a collaboratively editable document,
  cross-referencing all open tasks. Have this agenda in a place where
  everyone can find it, and have it ready no later than 15 minutes
  prior to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, transform the agenda into your meeting
  notes. This is something a collaboratively editable document (like a
  wiki page or Google Doc) makes easy. Appoint a responsible
  note-taker or scribe, whose job it is to compile the meeting notes,
  edit minor glitches and errors, and then let you know the notes are
  ready for consumption. You may decide that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who is in the
  meeting can co-edit the notes, and this can be very beneficial to
  make sure that even the quiet voices are heard. But it’s the
  scribe’s responsibility to bring them into good shape, and it’s your
  responsibility as the team lead to make sure they’re truthful and
  accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend the first 15-20 minutes of the weekly meeting on non-work
  topics. Ask something like “how was your weekend” or “how are things
  going in your part of the world” or anything else that you can think
  of that helps you feel the mood of your team. These things don’t go
  on the meeting record. Always accept when people don’t want to give
  an answer. They may have many reasons, none of which are necessarily
  your business. Trust that they’ll share whatever they’re comfortable
  sharing, even if some weeks that’s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to keep each other appraised of your relative progress and
  status via a simple, central coordination facility, such as a
  virtual Kanban board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to &lt;a href="https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/41002-writing-to-be-understood/"&gt;write to be
  understood&lt;/a&gt;,
  and encourage your team to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not attempt to get back to people “immediately”, and do not
  expect people to get back to you promptly. A reasonable default
  expectation for reply times is 24 hours. If you need an answer
  faster, you can always send an email (or better still, a comment on
  a card or ticket) with a request like “if I could get this by 1600
  UTC today, that’d be excellent.” Bonus points if you add &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you
  need that information quickly, as in “… so I can put this together
  with Kim’s performance data and make a decision on which load
  balancing strategy we’ll use, which Alex needs to know by tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish a convention for marking things as urgent, when
  needed. The word &lt;em&gt;URGENT&lt;/em&gt;, included in capital letters in an email
  subject or a chat message, usually works well. &lt;em&gt;Only&lt;/em&gt; use this if
  things are on fire.&lt;sup id="fnref:not-urgent-by-default"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:not-urgent-by-default"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt; use the urgency
  marker just by itself. (That’s a &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings"&gt;naked
  ping&lt;/a&gt; on steroids.)
  Also, when someone legitimately uses the marker in communication
  with &lt;em&gt;you,&lt;/em&gt; honour it. When someone uses it for something other than
  a legitimate reason, take them to task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get used to referring back to written communication, such as ticket
  comments or the record of a meeting, weeks or months later. This is
  not “pulling out the receipts” or “quoting chapter and verse” at
  someone. It simply serves to establish that yes, we have a written
  record of just about everything, and there is no need to keep these
  things stored in our heads under a banner saying “must not forget”
  (the latter being a major contributor to personal stress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t attempt to hide your own mistakes and misjudgements. They’re
  on the record. That makes them a learning opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually establish firm communication rules with your team. Many of
  these won’t need to be autocratically decreed, because they just
  make sense and people tend to intuitively agree on them (like the
  just-mentioned &lt;em&gt;URGENT&lt;/em&gt; marker and the circumstances under which to
  use them). Then, make sure you &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/09/16/rules-are-rules/"&gt;stick to
  them&lt;/a&gt;. Stick to them yourself, and
  correct others who break them.&lt;sup id="fnref:asshole-filter"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:asshole-filter"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, &lt;em&gt;let your team know&lt;/em&gt; that you’re working on getting them
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; out of meeting hell. Don’t sugarcoat things if you’re struggling
while swimming against the company tide, at least temporarily. If they
know you’re actively striving to make their work situation better, more
productive &lt;em&gt;and healthier&lt;/em&gt; it may well make the difference between
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/01/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-employees/"&gt;them leaving&lt;/a&gt; and
staying on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, keep an eye on corporate policy and the messages you get from
company leadership. If they’re obviously stuck in 1995, you might as
well go and update your CV. If the people at the top do &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/03/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-executives/"&gt;make an
effort to implement distributed and async friendly
policies&lt;/a&gt;,
however, then things may not change overnight, but there’s hope that
change they will, and your effort will not be for naught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:non-disparagement"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way: if your non-disparagement clause is
so harsh that you can’t talk about &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; negative in the
company, then that’s probably an awful company to begin with. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:non-disparagement" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:not-urgent-by-default"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the convention of the &lt;em&gt;URGENT&lt;/em&gt;
marker also establishes the convention that things are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
urgent by default. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:not-urgent-by-default" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:asshole-filter"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to enforce sensible collaboration rules may
  result in the inadvertent creation of an &lt;a href="https://siderea.livejournal.com/1230660.html"&gt;asshole
  filter&lt;/a&gt;. “Oh but I
  can’t enforce that rule on Bob, because Bob thinks rules aren’t for
  him but he’s brilliant!” — No. &lt;a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-11-13/brilliant-jerks.html"&gt;Don’t tolerate brilliant
  jerks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:asshole-filter" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

This article is on what you can do if you are stuck in meeting hell as a regular employee who isn&amp;rsquo;t in a management role.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please have a look at the
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/09/30/getting-out-of-meeting-hell/"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; for
background, for applicable disclaimers, and for information about
the specific environments this series talks about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you’re a regular employee (sometimes called an &lt;em&gt;Individual
Contributor&lt;/em&gt; or IC), who doesn’t have a team that reports to you. And
you are in an organization that, although it does have remote
employees or may even have switched to an all-distributed mode on
account of the pandemic, does not adopt basic rules of
distributed work and asynchronous communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You spend more time in meetings than is healthy, your productivity is
severely impacted, you’re stressed out from frequent interruptions,
you have trouble getting into a state of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;. You may be
asked to keep your camera on for hours at a time, and you feel that
this badly encroaches on your privacy or sense of personal space. Your
manager or your peers like to
&lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings"&gt;naked-ping&lt;/a&gt; you or
send you “hey, I need you for a minute” one-liners that &lt;a href="https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/"&gt;disrupt your
train of
thought&lt;/a&gt;
for half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And your organization (including your peers and direct manager)
tolerate or condone this kind of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like your typical day, I have great news for you. You
have at hand an excellent opportunity to improve your personal
situation, be more productive, and communicate better with your peers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leave.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand in your notice. Quit. Hightail it outta there. If &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want to truly improve your personal situation and work
  effectively in a distributed team, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neither your direct manager nor the top leadership of the
  organization takes any interest in optimizing for distributed and
  asynchronous collaboration,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then the way to do that &lt;em&gt;for yourself&lt;/em&gt; is to leave your current
organisation behind, and go elsewhere. There’s plenty of employment
opportunities for you to pick up in this industry at this time, and
there are a number of organizations that handle distributed work
better than the one you’re currently in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you could consider trying to change the system from within. And
there is a small (I’d say minute, but nonzero) probability that you’ll
be successful, and drive real change in your organization. However,
there is an inordinately &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; probability that you’ll burn out in
the process — and endangering your health is never a gamble that’s
worth taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that that’s a pessimistic view. I think the opposite is
true. You’re not “failing” to drive change in an organization that
resists it, instead you can succeed at pushing change in an
organization that embraces it. Throwing your energy into meaningful
change for the better is the definition of optimism, in my book. And
if the place for that is elsewhere from where you are now, seize that
opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, note that the foregoing is all predicated on the entire
company (including your direct manager) being &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; with synchronous
work and people having their calendar jammed with back-to-back
meetings, with no apparent intent to change. If it’s just you that
wants change, or perhaps only you and people at your level in &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt;
teams that you can’t reasonably join forces with, I’d argue that you
just shouldn’t be risking your health. In contrast, if your
manager&lt;sup id="fnref:direct-manager"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:direct-manager"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a couple of your peers are on your side —
consider your manager may be in their own
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/02/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-managers/"&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt; phase
about distributed and async collaboration — then things are a lot less
clean cut, and maybe you’d want to stay on for the ride. Particularly
so if there’s an active, supportive push &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/10/03/getting-out-of-meeting-hell-executives/"&gt;from the
top&lt;/a&gt; of the
organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if&lt;/em&gt; your manager and some of your peers are on your side, I can
think of a few situations where you should still leave: like when your
company has an “always on camera” policy, or doesn’t allow people to
go audio-only on calls, or promotes &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/teams-reporting-reference"&gt;number crunching on employee
“engagement” in a meeting
app&lt;/a&gt;. Companies
doing that are, in my view, beyond salvation and will never be able to
attain the levels of trust required for a distributed organization to
function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: if you’re stuck in meeting hell with nobody on your side, as a
regular employee with no reports, your best way forward is probably
the way to the exit. If you’re stuck in meeting hell &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; but there’s
a gale blowing the company into async &amp;amp; distributed mode, and/or you
have a very thick-skinned manager that gets it, and will deflect and
absorb any pressure from meeting-addicted higher-ups, you may want to
hang on for the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:direct-manager"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d posit that the only manager that really matters
in this scenario is your &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; line manager. That person would
your make-or-break partner in any transformation of how your team
collaborates. If you and they don’t share views, then don’t expect
to be able to play four-dimensional chess by forming an alliance
with some &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; manager who you then expect to influence &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt;
manager so that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; gets better at distributed and async
work. You don’t want to trade being stuck in meeting hell for
being in stuck in meeting hell &lt;em&gt;and corporate politics.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:direct-manager" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

This article is the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I presented a talk at &lt;a href="https://www.froscon.de"&gt;FrOSCon&lt;/a&gt;
titled &lt;a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/froscon2020-2605-no_we_won_t_have_a_video_call_for_that"&gt;No, we won’t have a video call for that: Communications for
distributed
teams.&lt;/a&gt;
In early 2021 I put together a full-length writeup of that talk, and
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/"&gt;published it
here&lt;/a&gt;. And for no
apparent reason that article then &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28636536"&gt;made it to the top of Hacker
News&lt;/a&gt; on one day in
September 2021,&lt;sup id="fnref:newsy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:newsy"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and apparently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/1442371424543444994"&gt;resonated with quite a few
people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after that, I got a fair number of questions along the lines of
“okay, what you talk about is a spot-on description of how I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to
work, but how do I get there?” In other words, &lt;strong&gt;what can you do in
order to transition from a team that’s stuck in meeting hell, to one
that actually goes fully distributed and embraces asynchronous
communications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I use the shorthand &lt;em&gt;Meeting Hell&lt;/em&gt; for a situation in
which people are forced to be in unnecessary and unproductive video
meetings&lt;sup id="fnref:in-person-meeting"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:in-person-meeting"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for an unhealthy fraction of their work
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is admittedly a mere &lt;em&gt;symptom&lt;/em&gt; of not having adopted
asynchronous and distributed ways of working, but it’s such a
tell-tale sign thereof that it counts as a dead giveaway. Thus, I
think it’s okay to say “I’m stuck in meeting hell” when what someone
means is really “I work in an organization that’s failing badly at
distributed and asynchronous work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I’m doing here is offer &lt;strong&gt;suggestions&lt;/strong&gt; for getting out of that. If&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you’re one of the people that has 25 meetings a week, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28652514"&gt;spend 60% of your work
  week&lt;/a&gt; in standups and
  planning and retro, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only time you have for doing what you actually signed up for &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28653696"&gt;is
  in overtime&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it’s grinding you down, and you want to work differently, then
this series might be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal strategies: one size does not fit all&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s very important to &lt;strong&gt;differentiate personal strategies&lt;/strong&gt; for
getting to distributed &amp;amp; async, based on your position in the company
or organization. So, I’m going to look at it from three angles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your options if you are what some companies call an “Individual
   Contributor”, or IC. In other words, these are for you if you are a
   &lt;strong&gt;regular employee&lt;/strong&gt; (or contractor), and you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; personally
   responsible for other people — in other words, you have no reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your options if you are at some level of &lt;strong&gt;management&lt;/strong&gt; that is
   &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; top organizational leadership. That is to say, you have
   people that report to you, but you also report to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your options if you’re a &lt;strong&gt;top-level executive&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning you’re a
   Chief Executive Officer or Managing Director or Executive Director
   or something of the sort. You have people that report to you, but
   you don’t directly report to anyone — even though you may be
   answerable to a Board of Directors or some other oversight body, of
   course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;These are my views, not self-evident truths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m only going to talk about my industry (software-driven
technology) because that’s the only industry I feel remotely qualified
to talk about. Also, I have never worked in a company that had more
than 3,000 employees, and I feel most at home in small outfits under
50. I’m reasonably confident that what I talk about is somewhat useful
for companies from 3 to 3,000 people in the software industry. It
&lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be applicable elsewhere — larger companies, other industries —
but at any rate, I make no guarantees of any kind. Feel free to adopt
an entirely contrarian position. And, you should also know I am not a
scientist, so none of what I write is informed by rigorous empiricism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, are we cool with that? &lt;strong&gt;My opinion, my thoughts, my views — not
pronouncements of absolute truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:newsy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context: it was at the top for like three hours on a
Saturday morning. So it might have landed there just because
enough people were simultaneously bored enough to give it a
read… &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:newsy" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:in-person-meeting"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting Hell might &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; apply to excessive
in-person meetings in a shared work space, such as an
office. However, I really don’t believe my industry will ever go
back to defaulting to office-based work, now that it has shown for
nearly two years that it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; function, in principle, in a
default-distributed mode. Thus, I am using the word “meeting” as
synonymous with “video meeting” in this series, and I wouldn’t be
surprised if this eventually became the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of this as
akin to the transition undergone by the word &lt;em&gt;call:&lt;/em&gt; before
the advent of the telephone, a &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; was a visit you paid to
someone’s house. Then, if you metaphorically “visited” someone by
telephone, that was a &lt;em&gt;telephone call&lt;/em&gt;. Now a &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; is always a
phone call, except when explicitly specified as a &lt;em&gt;house call.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:in-person-meeting" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Here&amp;rsquo;s why I am.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a reputation among my colleagues that I am very strict and
rigid about the communications rules I follow for myself, and for my
team. That reputation is entirely deserved, and I am indeed not
particularly flexible in my strong preference for asynchronous,
non-interruptive communication methods. I have discussed
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/CyzoF7mHEBo"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/"&gt;at
length&lt;/a&gt;, what
those are and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I have that strong preference. But I haven’t
really outlined why I very rarely allow myself, or others if I can
help it, to deviate from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Florian, the complaint usually goes, can’t you occasionally make
an exception? Sometimes there’s something you could easily do to
unblock someone else, if they could only quickly chat you up and ask
you to jump in. You’d be in and out of there in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s use an analogy here.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you’re out of an indispensable food product, say milk or flour
or potatoes or eggs. So you make a quick run to the grocery store, and
because you don’t live in a country with proper cycling infrastructure
and the store is out of walking distance, you drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You arrive at the grocery store parking lot, and for some unfathomable
reason it’s chock full. Completely packed. Not a single spot
available. Except those two spots right near the store entrance that
are reserved for wheelchair users, which you are not. You don’t see a
single car around with a wheelchair plaque or decal. Not even one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now. When you look at the situation, the objectively simplest and most
practical solution is for you to park in a wheelchair spot. You know
exactly how long it takes you to buy a carton of eggs; you’d be in and
out of that place in two minutes. The chance that one car needing a
wheelchair spot arrives in exactly that time is minute, and even then
there would be another one available. The probability of &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;
wheelchair users arriving in their cars, simultaneously, in those two
minutes, is infinitesimal. There is an overwhelming probability that
you will vacate the spot again, without it ever being needed by one of
its intended users while you were occupying it. So, why not use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that if it’s OK for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to break the rule that that
spot is for wheelchair users only, &lt;em&gt;there is absolutely no reason why
it shouldn’t also be OK for everyone else.&lt;/em&gt; You’re not special, the
same rules apply to you as to everyone else — so if we were to decide
that this rule &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; apply to you this very minute, then it also
needn’t apply to anyone else under similar circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, promptly, we’re in a situation where everyone flouts the
rules, and an actual wheelchair user can no longer do their grocery
shopping. That’s why you, if you are not a wheelchair user, shouldn’t
park there, and nobody else that isn’t shouldn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with interruptive communications — such as pinging someone in a
chat when you could send them an email just the same — it’s much the
same way: if you needlessly ping me and I acquiesce, drop the thing
I’m doing, and focus on your interruption instead, it would be unfair
of me to not do the same for somebody else. And I know if &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;
does this to me, my work day is purely interrupt driven and that’s
awful. The same goes for tolerating interruptive communications
towards my team — or, worse, engaging in such interruptive
communications myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are there exceptions to this rule?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah but of course. Let me take you back to the grocery store. Suppose
someone had a heart attack or other major health emergency that struck
them down right as they were exiting the store and walking back to
their car. Would anyone — including a wheelchair-using motorist that
arrived just at that moment to do their shopping — complain if the
ambulance parked across &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; wheelchair accessible spots, if that
was the only practical way to get closest to the patient? I hope
not. And caring for the patient and stabilising them for the trip to
the hospital would surely take longer than your two-minute egg
procurement dash that we discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this has a parallel in interruptive communications in a (much
less dire) regular work situation: stuff is actually on fire? Or
there’s something that for some legitimate reason needs doing &lt;em&gt;right
now&lt;/em&gt; that only I or someone on my team can do, or is most comfortable
with? Ping me in chat, use the back channel, give me a ring on my
&lt;em&gt;phone&lt;/em&gt; for cryinoutloud, whatever it takes to get my
attention. Nobody will hold that against you, least of all me. And in
this case that’s a rule that I can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; easily apply generally,
treating everyone around me fairly and equitably: when stuff is urgent
and seriously overrides the priority of what’s currently being worked
on, you get to interrupt me or, if necessary anyone on my
team. (Though I would prefer that you interrupt me specifically, and I
can decide whether we really need to mobilise another person.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just don’t abuse that. If you do, you’ll just condition people into
taking your sense of “urgent” with a big pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit, 2021-09-21:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

reasonably competent at is writing and publishing ads for open
positions, and I’ve received questions and requests for advice from
other folks who hire people. So I’m going to try and break down what I
consider a decent job ad. Not a perfect one mind you, perhaps not even
a particularly &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; one, just a decent one that people will want to
read, pass on, and maybe apply to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A few general notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to write an ad in such a way that it answers most of the
questions an applicant might have about the position. And I then
structure it like an imagined conversation between a potential
applicant (asking questions) and me, the hiring manager (answering
them). That’s why practically every subheading in the ad is a
question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my career ads, I give answers to this list of questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s this gig about? — The ultra-concise summary of the role to be
  filled. One sentence.&lt;sup id="fnref:one-sentence"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:one-sentence"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I be working on? — Details of the
  systems/processes/responsibilities associated with the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I know? — Prerequisite skills and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I learn? — Opportunities for acquiring new skills and
  knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What communities would I engage with? — People and communities
  &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; your organisation the employee would interact with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who would be my direct manager? — Information about yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How’s work at &lt;em&gt;company?&lt;/em&gt; — Notes on organisational culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does my team look like? — Notes on team composition and
  culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does my work week look like? — Information on how the team
  organises its work on a daily/weekly basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where can I work from? — Information about preferences or
  restrictions regarding the physical location of prospective
  employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I work from home?&lt;sup id="fnref:wfh"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wfh"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — Information about your remote work
  policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What timezone would I work in? — Most teams have preferred
  times-of-day when the majority of team members is awake and working,
  which tends to be when most work gets done. Or, else, your team may
  operate 24/7 in shifts, and you’re looking to cover a particular
  shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is travel involved? — Possibly a non-issue in the middle of a
  pandemic, but you might want to establish expectations for when it’s
  over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What employment conditions apply? — Have standard contractual
  clauses that apply to everyone, like vacation policies or specific
  packages? Might as well list them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When would I start? — Don’t assume that your applicants are
  available immediately. If people have a notice period in their
  current job to work with, they’ll want to know what’s the earliest
  and latest date you want the role filled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I make? — Compensation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I apply? — Details and deadlines related to the application
  process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few more details about several of these items, which I’ll try
to elaborate on as my time permits. So there should be more
installments in this series, eventually. Hopefully. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:one-sentence"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t condense the role description into one
sentence? You’ll either have to work on your editing skills, or
define the role better. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:one-sentence" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:wfh"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your answer to this question is “no”, I bid you good luck! &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:wfh" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

are still, for the most part, online-only events. (And I find myself
questioning the judgment of those that put on large in-person
conferences.) I have spoken at several of such conferences, and I’d
like to zero in on one aspect of my &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; experience, &lt;em&gt;as a
speaker,&lt;/em&gt; on some of the conference platforms I worked with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I should explain one thing up front. As a speaker, the thing I
care the most about is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is this talk useful to you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. That’s the paramount question. I want you to take something
away from the talk &lt;em&gt;that you find useful.&lt;/em&gt; Whether that’s a technical
insight, or a new angle on a problem, or even just entertainment, I
want there to be something in the talk &lt;em&gt;for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s incredibly important for me to get a sense of that, as I am
delivering the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in an in-person event, that’s easy: all I need is a look across
the room, and I &lt;em&gt;permanently&lt;/em&gt; look across the room. I can tell if
you’re making eye contact, or listening intently, or nodding your
head, or even putting on a face that makes it clear that you’re
violently disagreeing with me. Sure, if you raise your hand and ask a
question, or heckle me, or laugh at a joke, that drives the point of
your engagement home — but I don’t need you to become so &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt;
engaged, to know &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you are engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is &lt;em&gt;this kind of feedback&lt;/em&gt; (that you might not even realize
you’re giving me!) that makes the difference between delivering a
talk, and just speaking into the void. It’s also the difference
between delivering a conference talk, even if it’s a pre-recorded one,
and just uploading the video on YouTube. If an conference platform
doesn’t give me that kind of feedback channel, the work that I put
into writing, rehearsing, and recording/streaming the talk is better
spent with a view toward upload to a video hosting platform, and
engaging with viewers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I as a speaker am foremost interested in a single thing about the
conference platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is it easy for you to tell me if my talk is useful to you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about you getting into a chat and saying “this is
useful.” That’s much too high of a threshold. How often do you sit in
a talk and then &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; the speaker, “hey, that’s useful”? Quite
rarely, and only if you find the content &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; actionable or
insightful. Because you normally don’t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; tell me explicitly:
if you’re actively listening to me, I can tell. And I know you
wouldn’t be listening to me if I talked useless nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is one of the reasons why I like
&lt;a href="https://venueless.org/en/"&gt;Venueless&lt;/a&gt; so much. Venueless has
implemented an extremely low-threshold feature of showing audience
engagement. You get a handful of emoji like ❤️👏🤣👍🤔 that you, as a
viewer, can click on, and then they appear in the event chat stream
like “emoji rain” from the top of the screen. Just one click, which
also gets anonymized and lost in the crowd — this last bit is
important for people who are shy or reserved, and don’t like to stick
their head out. And this makes it so much easier for you to engage,
than having to actually type a sentence (or even a word, or even
&lt;em&gt;typing&lt;/em&gt; an emoji) into a chat channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can not tell you enough how much of a difference this makes to the
speaker experience.&lt;/em&gt; Add to this that the event chat is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; shackled
to Slack or any other horribly overgrown not-even-really-chat platform
anymore, and you’ve got a simple, easy-to-use, no-unnecessary-frills
experience that puts you &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; in touch with your audience. I
loved this at &lt;a href="https://2020.pycon.org.au/"&gt;PyCon AU&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, I also saw &lt;a href="https://loudswarm.com/"&gt;LoudSwarm&lt;/a&gt; at
&lt;a href="https://2021.djangocon.eu/"&gt;DjangoCon Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The way it was used in
that conference it seemed very tightly tied to Slack, although the
audience was very nice in using emoji reactions very
generously. Still, it wasn’t the same quality of feedback that
Venueless provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/lukas2511/voctoconf"&gt;Voctoconf&lt;/a&gt;, which I saw at
FrOSCon, allegedly predates Venueless and was excellent in terms of
streaming, but in terms of audience interaction it’s essentially
&lt;a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/"&gt;BigBlueButton&lt;/a&gt; on steroids, meaning it’s
about on the same level as the LoudSwarm/Slack combination I saw at
DjangoCon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="Conference"></category></entry><entry><title>Paying People</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2020/02/04/paying-people/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2020-02-04:/blog/2020/02/04/paying-people/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Paying people equally is straightforward, right? We all agree on that, and then once we’re talking about people living in different countries, we all disagree on what “equal” really means.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my now almost 10ish years of first running my own company, and then
managing a team in the company I sold my company to, I have very
frequently struggled with what’s a “fair” way of paying people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to the conclusion that when it comes to hiring distributed,
and thus hiring people living in different countries, there is no such
thing. At least not one that everyone agrees on to be fair. The best
thing we can hope for is an approximation of fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How much do you earn?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ask you how much you make, you’ll either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be very offended at the invasion of your privacy, and refuse to
  answer, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give me an answer straight away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which it is, is likely going to be determined by your culture and your
upbringing. I am Austrian, I have interacted a lot with Americans, and
now I work with Swedes — I can tell you, there are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different
views on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you choose to answer, you’ll likely have a number in
your head. And again, there are multiple ways you’ll think of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could be your annual salary, before income tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could be your monthly salary, before income tax and public
  healthcare and pension payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could be really weird, as in Austria: you’d think of your
  “monthly” salary, but in reality that’s 1/14th rather than 1/12th of
  your annual salary, because you’re paid a double salary in June and
  November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whichever it is, you’d probably think of a number, in your home
currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Equal work, equal pay. Right?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope we generally agree that two people who do the same (or
equivalent) work should be paid the same. And as long as you’re
comparing two people, living in the same place, whose salary is paid
out in the same currency, that’s easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about people from different countries? We can even assume
that those two countries use the same currency, to facilitate the
discussion. (Talking about &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; currencies makes things even
more murky, and is perhaps a topic for another article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the actual “worth” of the money you make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no correct answer for this. There are two possible approaches,
both of which are “wrong” in a way and “right” in another. Let’s say
we’re talking about two people being paid 3,000 euros a month, one
living in Finland, one in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could say that a euro is a euro. Thus, if you’ve got € 3,000 in
  your hand in Finland, that’s the same as having € 3,000 in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you could look at the question, what does that euro buy? If
  you’ve got € 3,000 in Finland, that will buy you things that, on
  average, you need to spend only about € 2,080 euros on in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So look at two people, one living in Finland and one in Greece. You
pay them both € 3,000 for the same work. Are you paying them equally,
or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you wouldn’t. If I had a person working for me in Finland, and
I paid that person € 3,000, and another person in Greece that also
made € 3,000 for the same work, I’d be massively short-changing the
person in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can argue that € 3,000 is € 3,000 and that’s the end of the
story. I tend to think that economists are on my side — that’s why the
concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity"&gt;purchasing power
parity&lt;/a&gt; (PPP)
exists —, but you can certainly be of the opposite opinion.&lt;sup id="fnref:inflation"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:inflation"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the problem that most PPP conversion rates are
per-country. And they may be way off if you compare, say, someone
living in Athens to someone living in
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84teritsiputeritsipuolilautatsij%C3%A4nk%C3%A4"&gt;Äteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsijänkä&lt;/a&gt;,
to stick with the Greece and Finland example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is, neither approach is perfect, and I can only
choose one approach or the other. And the approach that I’ve chosen,
in the distributed team that I run, is to make PPP adjustments. Others
opt for a different approach. Neither of these is right, or
wrong. They’re both an attempt to treat your people equally, and
neither is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:inflation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will put forward one small thought though: if you are
convinced that the money you earn is just that number in your
currency (as in, € 3,000 is € 3,000), then I posit that you should
also stick to that opinion in the face of inflation. Under that
assumption, then € 3,000 next year is still the same € 3,000 it
was this year, regardless of whether inflation was maybe 5%. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:inflation" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nearyd"&gt;Dave Neary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nearyd/status/1224727999951572993"&gt;in which he wondered
aloud&lt;/a&gt; why a
picture, which was very obviously (and poorly) doctored, made its way
onto Twitter. As if, so goes the reasoning, the creator of the picture
was ass enough to assume that no-one would notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s so obvious […] I just don’t understand why you’d bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, you can summarize this befuddlement by rephrasing the
question as follows: “why would anyone, in a political campaign even,
run with a lie that’s so easily called out?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumes that lying, deception, is something you’d prefer to go
undetected. And generally that’s true, human behavior works exactly
that way: when we lie and deceive — and humans do this all them time
for many reasons, some of them benign — the deception only works if it
isn’t caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do they lie, when it’s so easy to tell?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, what makes humans lie and spread falsehoods, even when they’re
easily detected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submit that to understand why, you should play a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is called &lt;a href="https://ncase.me/trust/"&gt;The Evolution of Trust&lt;/a&gt;,
and its creator is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ncasenmare"&gt;Nicky Case&lt;/a&gt;. You
can play it online, it’s available in multiple languages. And it will
take only about 15 minutes to complete. Go play it. No, really do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you play it? No? Well &lt;a href="https://ncase.me/trust/"&gt;it’s here&lt;/a&gt;. Please
go play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done? OK. Let’s carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does The Evolution of Trust tell us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game-theoretical concepts that The Evolution of Trust introduces
tell you three things about its simple game of cooperation and
defection (playing by the rules vs. cheating):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If communications between players are &lt;em&gt;perfect,&lt;/em&gt; then the most
  successful strategy is tit-for-tat (“copycat”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If communications are &lt;em&gt;imperfect,&lt;/em&gt; then the most successful strategy
  is tit-for-two-tats (or “tit for tat with forgiveness,” or
  “copykitten”) — &lt;em&gt;up to a certain error rate in communications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If communications are &lt;em&gt;imperfect beyond that error rate threshold,&lt;/em&gt;
  then the most successful strategy is to always cheat (“cheater”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; human communications are always messy, so the perfect
communications scenario is out the window. We’re always dealing with
imperfect communications, but we never know how high our error rate
is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most of us are brought up with the Golden Rule and a certain
measure of forgiveness. We tend to be “copykittens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now put yourself in the shoes of someone who has decided they’ll
take the cheater role. They’ll not play by the rules, they’ll only
ever fend for themselves and their own, everyone else be
damned. They’ve chosen the asshole route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their problem is, they can’t win. Game theory literally tells us that
the forgiveness strategy is superior. &lt;strong&gt;Except if the cheater manages
to increase the error rate beyond the threshold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you’ve decided you want to be an asshole, lie. It’s your only chance.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once you’ve decided that you’ll not play by the rules, your only
shot at winning is to destroy communications — for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And your best shot at that is to lie. Never tell the truth, contradict
objective facts, say the stupidest, dumbest, most blatantly false
things. Small lies, large lies, medium-sized lies. It does not matter
if your lie is exposed, in fact, your lies &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be exposed for your
strategy to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you know how to spot someone in politics who has decided to
break the rules. And why you shouldn’t assume they’re stupid, just
because they say objectively stupid things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="Politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Salacious Salad and Omelette</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2020/01/01/salacious-salad-and-omelette/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2020-01-01:/blog/2020/01/01/salacious-salad-and-omelette/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A breakfast experiment that turned out well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometime last year I came across a post on
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/food/"&gt;/r/food&lt;/a&gt; that I seem to be unable to
dig up. However, I recall that it had an infographic asserting that
for a salad to be perfect, it had to have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something tangy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something sweet,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something crunchy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some protein (egg or meat),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some dairy (yoghurt or cheese).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I goofed around preparing breakfast one Sunday morning, and out
came this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amounts are per person. Multiply as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fistful of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_leaves"&gt;rocket
  leaves&lt;/a&gt; (arugula).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some grapes, the smaller the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few cherry tomatoes. Best fresh off the vine in the middle of
  summer, even better if you can mix red, yellow, and purple
  varieties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few basil leaves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small amount of your favorite cold cut, say a thin slice or two of
  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto"&gt;prosciutto crudo&lt;/a&gt; or
  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresaola"&gt;bresaola&lt;/a&gt; (or
  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCndnerfleisch"&gt;Bündnerfleisch&lt;/a&gt;,
  if you want to get super fancy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few thin slices of Parmigiano or Grana Padano. Cutting them off
  the piece with a potato peeler works really well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch of black sesame seeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinaigrette:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few turns of freshly ground black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half a teaspoon of mustard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half a teaspoon of honey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dash of something spicy, if you’re into that sort of thing. Sambal
  oelek or sriracha sauce will work just fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omelette:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Butter (for frying)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 medium-size bowl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 small bowls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whisk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small frying pan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare the tomatoes: using a properly sharp kitchen knife, cut
   them into halves, quarters, or slices. Chuck them into a small bowl
   and sprinkle them rather liberally with salt and black
   pepper. Stack the basil leaves on top of each other and roll them
   up like tobacco leaves for a cigar, then cut the rolls into slices
   as thinly as you can. Throw the thin basil strands into the bowl,
   add some olive oil, and mix thoroughly using a spoon or your
   hands. Let the bowl sit on the countertop for five minutes or so,
   so that the tomatoes start oozing a bit of juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the vinaigrette: in a wide-enough bowl, put in salt, pepper,
   mustard, honey, and balsamic vinegar, and optionally the spicy
   condiment. Whisk to mix nicely, then add olive oil and whisk
   vigorously for 30-60 seconds. The goal is to get an opaque
   emulsion, with the mustard and honey acting as natural
   &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion#Emulsifiers"&gt;emulsifiers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw the rocket leaves and grapes into the vinaigrette bowl and
   mix thoroughly with (cleanly washed) hands. Let sit for a few
   minutes so that the vinaigrette can infuse the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crack egg into a small bowl, beat thoroughly with the whisk so the
   mixture is homogenous. Add a bit of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your serving plate, pieces of meat, cheese shavings, and
   black sesame are close by (if you’re a
   &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place"&gt;mise-en-place&lt;/a&gt;
   enthusiast, you’ve likely done this already) — once the omelette is
   ready, you want to serve things up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat up some butter in the small pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour the beaten egg in and cook your omelet. It will be very thin
   so this should take only a minute, perhaps two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw the omelet on the plate (don’t fold it) and then start
   stacking: rocket and grapes in vinaigrette at the bottom, then
   tomatoes in olive oil and basil, meat, cheese shavings finally
   sesame on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides managing to grow 10 years older, in this decade I founded 1
company, sold 1 company, left 1 company, joined 1 company, folded 0
companies, bankrupted 0 companies, raised precisely €0 of VC, provided
an income to a growing family, kept the bank accounts in the black
throughout, spent 836 days (2 years, 3 months, 2 weeks and 2 days) on
the road, traveled 947,000 kilometers (that’s about the length of a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumlunar_trajectory"&gt;circumlunar free
return&lt;/a&gt;
trajectory), visited 144 cities in 32 countries (including airport
stopovers), and gave about 72 talks (on average a little over one
every two months) at conferences and events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;hastexo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half the decade (6 years and 1 month, to be precise) is
occupied by my tenure at hastexo, the company I co-founded and led
from inception to acquisition by &lt;a href="https://www.citynetworkhosting.com/"&gt;City
Network&lt;/a&gt;. Coming off an excellent
stint at &lt;a href="https://linbit.com"&gt;Linbit&lt;/a&gt; — where I worked for 4.5 years,
and which I’m pleased to report is still around, alive, independent
and kicking (a rare feat in this industry) — my co-founders Martin,
Andreas and I bootstrapped a company that operationally broke even in
its third month, and earned its founding cost back in six (while
providing us a livelihood out of operational revenue). Though we never
went through any kind of meteoric rise or exponential growth — hardly
a thing in professional service companies devoid of hockey sticks — we
did make good calls in gaining a foothold in the Ceph and OpenStack
communities early on, and quickly established a reputation as
technical experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We parted ways three years in, and if we follow the analogy that that
sort of thing is something like a divorce, this was a particularly
amicable one. All of us are still on good terms, and even occasionally
have the opportunity to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hastexo also enabled me to meet my brilliant colleagues
&lt;a href="https://arbrand.es/"&gt;Adolfo&lt;/a&gt; (with whom I still work) and
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/syedarmani"&gt;Syed&lt;/a&gt; (who has since done a career
pivot and works in a completely different part of our industry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;City Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the decision to
&lt;a href="https://www.citynetwork.eu/pressreleases/city-network-shifts-high-gear-hastexo-acquisition/"&gt;sell&lt;/a&gt;
hastexo to &lt;a href="https://www.citynetworkhosting.com/"&gt;City Network&lt;/a&gt; in 2017
is something that I’ve never regretted. I generally get along very
well with the Scandinavian approach to work — something that I had
learned 10 years earlier when I had the pleasure of interacting
regularly with then-independent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB"&gt;MySQL
AB&lt;/a&gt; —, and City Network is no
exception here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously an integration into an acquirer is never entirely devoid of
friction,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; particularly when a fully distributed team meets a
previously fully office-driven company, but our colleagues turned out
to be an excellent bunch and I’m on a very good working basis with my
CEO Johan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At City Network I’ve also finally succeeded in doing something I’d
always failed at in the years prior, which is to have built a
gender-balanced team. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/namratasitlani"&gt;Namrata&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elenalindq"&gt;Elena&lt;/a&gt; are fantastic assets in a
highly professional, highly functional, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Axahteiwi%20MTIA"&gt;generally
awesome&lt;/a&gt; group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the excellent people I get to work with on a daily basis, I
have met an astonishing number of utterly amazing folks in this
decade. In fact, many of them have had so much influence on me that I
find it hard to believe I didn’t even know them a decade ago. It’s
straight-out impossible to list them all, so I’ve representatively
picked three people here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liewegas"&gt;Sage Weil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://ceph.io"&gt;Ceph&lt;/a&gt;
fame is possibly the strongest pairing of brilliance and humility
you’ll ever encounter. How many people do you know that &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-inktank-provider-ceph"&gt;made fuck-you
money&lt;/a&gt;
from something they thought up in &lt;a href="https://ceph.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/weil-thesis.pdf"&gt;their PhD
thesis&lt;/a&gt;,
then took some of that fuck-you money as &lt;a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/news/article/2349"&gt;a donation to their alma
mater&lt;/a&gt; where it endows a
professorship &lt;em&gt;that &lt;a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/news/article/2402"&gt;their PhD advisor now
holds&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It’s an
absolute privilege to know this guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoostini"&gt;Marco Ostini&lt;/a&gt; is, and will always
be, the face of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux.conf.au"&gt;linux.conf.au&lt;/a&gt; for me,
and I need to mention him here for his own sake and that of the
community he is a part of. When I arrived for &lt;a href="https://2011.linux.conf.au/"&gt;my very first
LCA&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, as a completely
inexperienced traveler, fatigued, jet-lagged and bleary-eyed as all
hell, there was this wonderful Aussietalian with a beaming smile
giving me the warmest of welcomes &lt;em&gt;at half-past midnight&lt;/em&gt; and
cheerfully gave me a lift to the accommodation. LCA 2011 was my best
conference up to that point, ran what &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; appears to be &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NyHJ8Uf03qg"&gt;my most
popular conference talk&lt;/a&gt; (largely thanks
to &lt;a href="https://ourobengr.com/"&gt;Tim Serong&lt;/a&gt;’s live cartooning), and kicked
off a series of LCAs for me that were always a warm fuzzy
shot-up-the-arm of Aussie and Kiwi hospitality in the middle of the
dark European winter. Not to mention the talks. And
Pac-Man. And hugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shar1z"&gt;Sharone Revah Zitzman&lt;/a&gt; has been my
constant and unbroken link to the Israeli cloud, open source, and
DevOps community. Sharone is basically a conference organizing
committee on two feet, and an incredibly nice and welcoming person to
boot. I’ve forged many friendships in the Israeli developer community
that would never have happened were it not for her, and I love coming
back to her neck of the woods for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I really dislike reading old emails (whether I sent them in
private or to public mailing lists) from the early 2010s, because they
remind me that more than occasionally I was abrasive to the point of
being an outright jerk. I hope that that has improved somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I did pretty well in the “immersing myself in new technology
and keeping current in it” department. At the start of the decade I
knew next-to-nothing about Ceph, OpenStack hadn’t even started, and
Open edX wasn’t yet under the AGPL. Today I feel kinda-sorta-OK in two
of those, and not-quite-an-idiot in the other, which is about as happy
as I’ll ever be with my limited knowledge of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; allowed myself to feel reasonably comfortable
about what I do as a manager, even if it means deviating from
conventional wisdom or established precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s see what the next decade holds. Happy new year, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know. It’s arbitrary. Gregorian calendar yada yada, plus
the discussion whether the decade ends at the end of 2019, or the
end of 2020. I don’t care. Now is as good as any time to look back
and reflect. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should really do a conference talk for startup founders on what

Works best in a castiron pan, but really any large pan will do.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve found this to be the pan pizza to end all pan pizzas. It’s my
standard pizza dough recipe, plus some inspiration from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/uYxB4QBlrx4"&gt;this
video&lt;/a&gt;. The trick with seasoning the pan
is an absolute kicker and makes the crust taste oodles better than
without that seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amounts are for one 26 cm pan that will likely feed 4 adults. Make
several to accommodate a larger crowd, or very hungry people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200g plain spelt flour&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;150g wholemeal spelt flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;150ml warm water&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10g fresh yeast (alternatively 7 grams dry yeast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;½ teaspoon honey (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7g salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good splash of olive oil, about 1-2 tablespoons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sauce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200g peeled and chopped canned tomatoes (alternatively a similar
  preparation from homegrown produce)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon of olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toppings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100g cheese (mozzarella is canonical, but coarsely grated mild young
  Gouda works surprisingly well and you should give it a shot if you
  have it available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spicy sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, ham, whatever you fancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pan seasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Splash of olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tablespoon of cornstarch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oregano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One large, thick-bottomed pan with a lid. Can be a cast iron
  skillet, or a non-stick pan, or a thick enamelled frying pan which
  is what I use. What’s important is that the bottom is at least 1cm
  thick, and that the handle can stand being under your oven
  broiler/grill for about 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stovetop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oven with broiler/grill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand mixer or kitchen appliance with a dough hook. If
  unavailable, your hands will work just fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare a poolish: dissolve the yeast (and honey, if you like) in
   half of the warm water, add flour until the mixture is something
   like porridge. Put in a warm spot&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and let rise until the volume has
   doubled (15-30 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add salt and poolish to the remainder of the flour in a bowl, knead
   and add enough water to make a homogeneous dough. Might take the
   full remaining 150ml, or less, depending on flour. Pour olive oil
   into bowl and and work some in, leaving the sides of the bowl
   nicely greased. Chuck bowl back into warm place and let rise for
   another 15-20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While dough rises, season the pan. Pour in olive oil, add
   cornstarch, and rub the mixture with your fingers over the whole
   inside of the pan — both the bottom and the walls.  Sprinkle salt,
   pepper, and oregano into the pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gently spread the dough into a flat round piece roughly the
   diameter of the bottom of the pan. You can use a rolling pin for
   this, but if you do, make sure to grease the rolling pin and
   countertop with olive oil, rather than dusting them with flour like
   you’re perhaps used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the dough rise one more time, about 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare the sauce. Simply mix chopped tomatoes with a good pinch of
   salt and some olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spread the sauce &lt;em&gt;all across the dough&lt;/em&gt;, covering the whole
   diameter of the pan. Do not leave any uncovered crust on the
   perimeter. Repeat with cheese and finally, toppings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn burner on medium heat, put the pan on (cover it with a lid),
   and cook for approximately 8-10 minutes. The trapped steam will
   cook the sauce and toppings on top, while the bottom of the pan
   bakes the crust. Preheat your broiler to high heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the cheese on top has started to melt, throw the pan under the
   broiler/grill for about 3 minutes until the cheese gets nice
   patches of golden brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn pizza out on a round pizza plate. It should easily come off
    the bottom of the pan, though the sides might require some
    scraping if cheese has melted and run down the sides. Cut into
    slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dig in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nutrition facts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No warranty of any kind on these. Values are per serving, counting one
serving as one-quarter of the whole pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’ve never baked with spelt flour before: tastes about
like wheat, but takes on less water. You can modify this recipe to
use wheat flour, in which case you’ll need about 375ml of
water. Also, while a wheat dough normally benefits from a long or
slow rise, I’ve found that not to be true for spelt. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re from the U.S.: yes I know, we Europeans are a bit
weird in that we customarily give some quantities by weight,
others by volume. You’d &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it’d be straightforward that we do
solids by weight and liquids by volume, but it isn’t. (Some
recipes specify sugar by weight, for example, others say use
so-and-so-many tablespoons of sugar.) &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My oven has a leavening mode in which I can let a dough rise at
approximately 39°C and near 100% humidity, which is glorious, but
this is in no way a requirement. I’ve let dough rise in a bowl
placed on the floor (we have floor heating), on the running
laundry dryer, or out on the countertop. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the last 10-or-so years, but this year I made significant changes to
my process for creating, rehearsing, and presenting talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I used to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started doing talks a while back, I followed an approach that
many of us were at some point either taught, or adopted by emulating
our peers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would roughly sketch an outline,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I’d create slides (usually on a company or conference template),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I’d add some speaker notes in bullet-point fashion,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I’d rehearse the talk,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and finally I’d refine my content based on whether I was short or
  long in terms of the available time slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a very conventional approach, and it tends to focus very much
on getting the slides right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I do things differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I do now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to the conclusion that what I really want my audience to
focus on is what I am &lt;em&gt;talking&lt;/em&gt; about. So now, I do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still start with a rough — &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rough — outline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next though, I write my speaker notes. All of them. Yes, that means
  I write out my &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; talk, and this may well take days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I do a first practice run. Is there a good natural flow? Will
  it make sense to someone completely unfamiliar with my topic? Is the
  story I’m telling logical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I edit. This process of alternating rehearsal and edits
  continues until I’m reasonably happy with the whole talk, and I have
  timed it and am happy with my pacing, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then do I start creating my slides, and I usually completely
  disregard conference templates, for reasons I’ll get to in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that means that when I ultimately deliver the talk, I’m actually
reading from my notes. Except when I’m just riffing and ad-libbing
over them. Chances are, unless you know me very well, you’ll be unable
to tell. That’s because I write my notes like I talk, and I pay more
attention to flow and stress and rhythm than I do to grammar and
exactitude. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ruehcRDRIgM"&gt;This talk&lt;/a&gt;, just like
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ZifNGprBUTA"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cRqA-eYYOXE"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; were all delivered from fully
written speaker notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully writing out my talk has also enabled me to greatly reduce my use
of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(linguistics)"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; (like
“ah” and “um”), which I used to say excessively and which would make
me cringe at my talk videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to explain why I normally disregard conference templates: In
preparing and delivering my talks, I try to put a greater emphasis on
accessibility that I used to before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my slides are now all high-contrast. I default to using &lt;a href="https://fghaas.github.io/cookiecutter-presentation/#/3"&gt;black text
  on a white
  background&lt;/a&gt;
  (this is a good default for when I have reason to assume the
  projection equipment will be less than perfect), alternatively I use
  white text on a black background (for darkened rooms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to accommodate people with the most common types of color
  blindness: I use blue — as opposed to red or green – as my highlight
  color, and in
  &lt;a href="https://fghaas.github.io/cephalocon2019-rbdmirror/#/8/2"&gt;charts&lt;/a&gt;, I
  differentiate by both color and line stroke. I also try to refrain
  from using animations. As for slide transitions, I use only fade, no
  motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I publish my slides ahead of time, include a QR code at the very
  beginning, and I use reveal.js Multiplex so that my slides advance
  in unison with those one people’s phones, tablets, or laptops. This
  way, people with less-than-perfect vision (or simply seated in an
  unfortunate spot, at the back of the room) can follow along easily
  and and their own preferred zoom level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my speaker notes are fully written out, this means that I can
  also &lt;a href="https://fghaas.github.io/cookiecutter-presentation/#/intro"&gt;include
  them&lt;/a&gt; in
  the published material, so that my notes can act as subtitles for my
  speaking. This can come in handy to people who are hard of hearing,
  or who are simply unaccustomed to my accent or manner of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve rolled these accessibility considerations into my opinionated,
&lt;a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/"&gt;Cookiecutter&lt;/a&gt;-based reveal.js
&lt;a href="https://github.com/fghaas/cookiecutter-presentation"&gt;presentation
generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A request&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be visually impaired, or color blind, or hard of
hearing, or you work with people who are – in other words, if you can
make a suggestion for me to improve the accessibility of my slides,
&lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/fghaas/cookiecutter-presentation/issues"&gt;file an
issue&lt;/a&gt;
against my Cookiecutter and I’ll try to work that in as best I
can.

Here are some thoughts and suggestions on team meetings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve run a distributed team — nominally the same team, though through
people joining and leaving I am the sole original band member at this
point — for almost 8 years. And about 3 years in was the first time we
were sufficiently spread &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; had enough money to spare to warrant
flying everyone to the same place for one week per year. We have been
doing that ever since. Every year, it’s an exceedingly enlightening
and pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this year was the first time that we did not one but &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; team
meetings back to back: first with my core team running education
services at City Network, in the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellerup"&gt;Hellerup&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood in
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, and then as
part of the complete City Network all-hands meeting on the island of
Tjärö in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blekinge_archipelago"&gt;Blekinge
archipelago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is how we do these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accommodation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the very first team meeting we did in 2014 when we put
everyone up in hotel rooms, we’ve always rented a house. I’m a
believer in small team sizes — 5 people being the maximum number of
direct reports a leader can realistically have —, so that means that
we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; still find houses where everyone has a room to themselves,
and nobody has to queue for a shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider both of these things extremely important. Many, many people
working in tech are introverts, even more so for people working &lt;em&gt;from
home&lt;/em&gt; in tech. Many of us find the experience of constantly being
around people emotionally draining, and we need solitude to
recharge. Also, privacy. Our personal lives don’t stop while we’re
having a team meeting, so you might want to have a room in which you
can talk about your kid’s health issue with your spouse, without
concern about colleagues overhearing the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price-wise, since this puts us in an accommodation category that can
qualify as a penthouse or mansion, this won’t be significantly cheaper
than hotel accommodation — but it won’t be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; expensive either,
and it’ll be a much nicer experience. Particularly if you also have
the joy of interacting with an exceedingly pleasant, nice, and helpful
person for a host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; scouts the accommodation, my rule has always been this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case we have a person on the team who lives, or has lived, in the
  city we’re going to, and who thus is very familiar with the locality
  and surroundings, I delegate the search to them. You can never beat
  local personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I do the scouting on the web, and I usually run it by the
  team — after I have made the booking, but while we can still cancel
  or change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever did the scouting for the accommodation travels a day
early, gets the key, settles in, and reports back. This has multiple
purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are local and so is the host, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; that’ll facilitate
  matters a lot. Particularly if we’re in a country where that one
  team member speaks the language, and the rest of us don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s something seriously wrong with the property, they can
  still cry foul and we can make other arrangements while we’re not
  all congregated in the same spot. (This has never happened to us,
  but just in case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That person is our support backstop who can field issues and
  customer questions, while everyone else is in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That person can also meet and collect people at the airport or train
  station, if getting to our accommodation is nontrivial or
  difficult. Also, this is particularly helpful when we have a new
  team member who is perhaps less travel experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I normally don’t schedule any formal work sessions for the first
day. People will be jet-lagged and fatigued from travel, we are often
re-meeting in person for the first time in a year, and there is a lot
of catching up to do about family, hobbies, recent travel, and all
sorts of things that are not work. Somebody might be new and we might
see them for the first time ever, in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then of course people might be delayed in travel, may have had
flights cancelled, or may have missed connections. So that means if
you’re actually &lt;em&gt;planning&lt;/em&gt; the first day to be full of “work”
sessions, you ran a significant chance of your schedule getting
wrecked by a flight delay. So we just don’t do that. Instead, we try
to make the first day as relaxed and as enjoyable as possible,
including a nice first group dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then sometimes, as happened this year, a &lt;em&gt;remarkably&lt;/em&gt; serious and
productive discussion over work issues ensues over a glass of wine in
the evening. But that’s not part of the expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to have half-day work sessions these days, where we focus on
one topic for 3-4 hours straight. These can get intense, and sometimes
heated, but they are nearly always very, very productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We typically use a place like our house’s kitchen (if it’s roomy, and
has a table), or patio (if it’s bearable outside), or sitting room (if
it’s cozy) for work sessions. They are usually quite analog, with
frequently just one person — the assigned record-keeper, often me —
with a laptop open to take notes and record the discussion and its
outcomes. I’ve found that on occasion, when discussing complex issues,
working with a roll of brown paper and thick felt-tip markers
(“sharpies” for you Americans out there) can be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more useful
than with anything pushing bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy food, and I’ve never worked with anyone who doesn’t. So we
make that part enjoyable in whatever way we fancy. We might go for
lunch to the neighborhood bagel store that our host recommended for
their excellent pastrami. We might jump on a train to get to a street
food spot, or head out for pizza or tacos or curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m buying. These meetings are for work, my team is traveling for
just that purpose, so whenever we eat together (and we practically
always do), the tab is on me. What I can put on the company and what
comes out of my own pocket is my job to sort out later, but we’re
definitely not going Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interesting things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our meetings are usually in an interesting city with art,
architecture, and history, and not seeing any of that would be a bit
of a waste. So there’s usually maybe two to three things that we just
go and do. It could be a harbor or river cruise, a visit to a castle
or palace, a bicycle tour criss-crossing the city, or a museum
visit. Depends a bit on the weather and a bit on individual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epilogue: going larger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what works for a 5-person team clearly doesn’t work for a whole
company, not least because you’ll be hard pressed to find a rental
home with 40 bedrooms — I guess such a dwelling would be appropriately
referred to as a palace, and last I checked the Queen wasn’t on
Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can take a page out of City Network’s playbook and do
something else, which is to book an island. Yes, you read that right,
immediately after our &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; meeting we packed up and boarded a train
to join our &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; all-hands meeting, in which we had an island
practically to ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="Philosophy"></category></entry><entry><title>Nonexisticon</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2019/04/27/nonexisticon/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2019-04-27:/blog/2019/04/27/nonexisticon/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have no experience with, and presently no plans for, running or

organizing a grassroots knowledge-sharing conference. But if I did run
one, and I could shape it exactly as I wanted, this might be what it
would look like. Please be advised that I have no idea what I am
talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about Nonexisticon, the non-existent conference. Just to
benefit your reading flow, dear reader, I am using the indicative
rather than the subjunctive mood, in other words, I use phrases like
“Nonexisticon &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;” as opposed to “Nonexisticon &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I
trust that you are not confused by this, as the name very clearly
implies that the conference does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unifying Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon’s theme is freely shared knowledge work. &lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon
brings together open-data researchers, open-source software and
hardware engineers and designers, Creative Commoners, documentarians,
writers, artists, educators.&lt;/strong&gt; Basically, if you create something with
your mind and you make your creation freely available for anyone to
use, enhance, modify and build upon, you’re welcome at
Nonexisticon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is also a mutually supportive conference, where
corporate-funded or financially secure attendees can commit to
supporting less-privileged ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Location and Reach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon is a regional conference.&lt;/strong&gt; “Region” in this context
means an area from which the conference attendees can reasonably
travel to the conference location, using environmentally friendly
transportation modes (such as high-speed rail). Attendance from
outside the region is welcome, but for environmental reasons it is not
encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is typically held on a university campus, or other
suitable facility, in a location well accessible by public
transportation. Cheap accommodation is typically available on-campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supporting Organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is organized by the Nonexisticon Association, a
not-for-profit organization that allows only individual, not corporate
membership. The organization is staffed by volunteers, that is to say,
while it is authorized to reimburse members of the conference team for
expenses incurred and income lost as a direct result of conference
work, it does not pay salaries to its staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon registration includes membership in this organization,
with full voting rights, for a period of two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recurrence and Length&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any regional Nonexisticon has its own recurrence schedule, but the
conference is never held in the same region more than &lt;strong&gt;once per
year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Nonexisticon has a general theme. Themes can be quite diverse and
are generally broadly defined, so as to attract individuals from many
disciplines and backgrounds (as long as they relate to the unifying
theme of freely shared knowledge work). Examples for conference themes
are “cancer research”, “the Python programming language”, “high-energy
physics”, or “the arts in education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is run by a Conference Committee, which is a &lt;strong&gt;group of 5
individuals headed by a Conference Director.&lt;/strong&gt; The Conference
Committee serves for the run-up, duration, and wind-down of one
Nonexisticon, oversees the appointment of the succeeding Committee,
and acts as advisors to the incoming Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would-be Conference Committees prepare a bid for the next
Nonexisticon. Bids specify the conference location, dates, venue,
capacity, theme, proposed sponsorship opportunities, and budget. If a
bid is uncontested, the prior Conference Committee merely assesses the
bid for plausibility and compliance with formal criteria, and accepts
the bid (thereby also appointing the new Conference Committee). If
more than one bid exists, the outgoing Conference Committee organizes
an on-line vote among the Association membership, using a preferential
voting system. The winning bid then results in the appointment of the
new Conference Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Presentations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is a &lt;strong&gt;single-track conference, with one presentation
slot length available: 30 minutes.&lt;/strong&gt; Nonexisticon typically runs over
the course of &lt;strong&gt;three days,&lt;/strong&gt; with talks scheduled between 09:00 (9am)
and 18:00 (6pm) local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that after deducting conference opening and closing
remarks, keynotes, and breaks, &lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon has 38 talks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in
total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q&amp;amp;A time is at the speaker’s discretion; forgoing Q&amp;amp;A entirely is
acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All presentations are &lt;strong&gt;open for rating&lt;/strong&gt; by attendees for a short
time period of 5 minutes prior to, and 15 minutes after scheduled
conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations are &lt;strong&gt;recorded&lt;/strong&gt; by a professional A/V team, and
publicly released under a permissive license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Presentation Proposals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon uses an &lt;strong&gt;anonymized call for proposals (CFP),&lt;/strong&gt;
conducted online, using an open-source conference platform. The
Conference Committee defines the format of the CFP proper, including
the questions posed at submitters. The Conference Committee reviews
all submitted proposals, anonymized, for formal compliance with the
CFP only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon attendance &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; the submission of a presentation
proposal.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus, conference registration and presentation submission
are one and the same process. The conference registration fee must be
paid in full at the time of registration/submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon limits proposals to one per speaker/attendee. All
presentations are solo; multi-presenter talks and panel discussions
are not permitted.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Underprivileged Attendee Fund&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prospective attendees unable to accommodate the registration fee,
conference travel, or accommodation&lt;/strong&gt; may apply, upon registration, to
the Underprivileged Attendee Fund.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If accepted (per decision by the
Conference Committee), the speaker/attendee is invited to attend the
conference free of charge, and their submitted presentation is
included in proposal review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Underprivileged Attendee Fund is endowed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;corporate conference sponsorship,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;donations to the Nonexisticon Association,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profits carried over from prior conferences,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;donations from regular speaker-attendees who voluntarily put up
  double the regular application fee upon their own
  registration/proposal submission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Review process and talk selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talks are selected by all attendees/speakers&lt;/strong&gt; during a time-limited
selection period using a &lt;a href="http://www.deborda.org/faq/voting-systems/what-is-a-modified-borda-count.html"&gt;modified Borda count
(MBC)&lt;/a&gt;
ranking process, as pioneered by the scientific community &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.1943"&gt;for
allocating observation time on astronomical
telescopes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, every attendee is assigned a small, randomly selected
set of proposals (about 10, and excluding their own submission) to
review. They then rank these submissions not in an order of
subjectively “best” to “worst”, but from &lt;em&gt;most beneficial to the overall
attendee community&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;least beneficial to the overall attendee
community.&lt;/em&gt; This results in an overall preliminary ranking of
submissions, which is then compared to each attendee’s individual
ranking. A high degree of agreement of an individual attendee’s
ranking with the overall preliminary tally results in additional
points for the attendee’s own proposal; the contrary, in subtracted
points. Ultimately, this produces a final, definitive ranking of all
received proposals.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire ranking process is automated using open-source software,
and both the preliminary and the final ranking result are publicized
to all attendees/submitters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submitters of the 48 top-ranked presentations (38 plus 10
backup/waitlist presentations) are refunded their registration fee
upon acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an accepted speaker needs to withdraw their talk, the next-ranked
talk automatically moves up, and the speaker’s registration is
simultaneously canceled.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Budget and Sponsoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon’s budget calls for a barebones conference (infrastructure
only, no catering, no childcare) to break even solely on
registration fees equivalent to two-thirds of the venue capacity. In
case of registrations being in excess of this threshold, Nonexisticon
funds childcare, refreshments, and catered lunch, in that order.&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is open to sponsoring. Sponsoring, however, does not buy
presentation slots, nor does it have any bearing on keynote
selection. Sponsors can choose to contribute to infrastructure,
catering, childcare, the Underprivileged Attendee Fund, and social
events. Of these, social events are the only category open
&lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; to sponsor funding; Nonexisticon does not spend
registration fee revenue on social events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If registrations do not meet the two-thirds threshold, and the budget
shortfall cannot be compensated by sponsor contributions or profits
carried over from prior conferences, the conference is cancelled and
registration fees refunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon has one keynote, which opens the conference.&lt;/strong&gt; The
Conference Committee extends the keynote speaker invitation by
consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing “keynote” is a reprise of the highest-rated presentation
in the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference run-up timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon’s attendee-visible run-up cycle is 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a Nonexisticon is scheduled to run from May 15-17, the
following schedule applies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table-striped table"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disclaimer and acknowledgments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to reiterate that I have no experience whatsoever in running
or putting on a conference, since the only time I’ve contributed to
them as something other than a mere speaker, I’ve sat on proposal
selection committees. So take all of what I wrote above with a
mountain of salt, and consider it nothing more than semi-elaborate
handwaving full of glaring omissions. But if you do want to give me
some feedback, even it is simply telling me &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; my ideas are nuts —
as opposed to just &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; they are — I’d be most grateful. Find me on
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, thanks to &lt;a href="https://tom.eastman.nz/"&gt;Tom Eastman&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1121515902833311745"&gt;prompting
me&lt;/a&gt; to put
this in writing, to &lt;a href="https://about.me/michael.merrifield"&gt;Professor Mike
Merrifield&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7c0CoXFApnM"&gt;introducing me
to the MBC approach&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href="http://www.bradyharan.com/"&gt;Brady
Haran&lt;/a&gt; for making the
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A"&gt;Numberphile&lt;/a&gt;
YouTube channel where I learned about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear grammar stickler, I am acutely aware that a phrase
including &lt;em&gt;would + infinitive&lt;/em&gt; is not a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; subjunctive
mood, but the use of a modal verb. Feel free to replace all such
instances with a true subjunctive in your head. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t bother to check the talk arithmetic. It doesn’t matter
whether it’s really 36 talks or 41 or 42. I just picked 38 as a
reasonable, concrete number to work with. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disallowing multiple submissions from one person, and
presentations with multiple speakers, is a necessary consequence
of the talk selection process. Allowing only one submission per
submitter also has the added benefit that prospective speakers can
focus on one single talk and give the proposal their very best
shot. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a better name for this? &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find this summary insufficient to explain the process but
also don’t feel like plowing through the paper, here’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7c0CoXFApnM"&gt;a video
explanation&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/bplncn4xC74"&gt;additional
information&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is admittedly harsh to only be able to pull out of an
accepted talk by pulling out of the conference altogether. I
consider this a necessary evil to ensure that no
attendee/submitter submit their proposal without genuine intent to
present. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, I am most on the fence about childcare. Meaning it
would probably be a good idea to always budget for child-care
cost, even if that means a higher registration fee for everyone,
and thus a slightly elevated risk of conference cancellation. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have spoken at tech conferences for the better part of a decade, and
up to this point I have only ever published &lt;a href="/category/presentations.html"&gt;my
talks&lt;/a&gt; after I’ve actually presented
them. I’ll change that from here on out, and I’ll instead record any
talk that I &lt;em&gt;submit&lt;/em&gt; to a conference instead, regardless of whether it
ultimately gets accepted or not. I do this for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d like to have a record of my talk submissions for my own
   reference purposes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s rather remarkable how many conference talk submission systems
exist that make it rather difficult to retrieve your submitted
abstract a few months or years after the conference. Some event
websites exist specifically for one instance of a particular
conference, so they might be taken down a few months after, and
unaccepted abstracts are usually not accessible publicly — so even
getting them via the &lt;a href="https://archive.org/"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; is
not an option. Others record talk submissions via Google Forms,
into a private Google Sheet, and don’t send an autoreply
containing the full submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I use this site for having my own record of talks I submit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t want to reinforce the illusion that just because I’m an
    experienced speaker, all talks I submit anywhere get accepted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get talks rejected all the time, &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; from conferences
I’d &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoy speaking at. This is normal, and if any of you
reading this are less experienced and find rejections
discouraging, I want you to know that they happen to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am curious about other people’s thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a speaker, it is pretty hard to get good feedback on a talk
submission. Very few conferences send you detailed feedback on
rejected talks. And none at all, to the best of my knowledge, send
you qualitative feedback on &lt;em&gt;accepted&lt;/em&gt; ones (other than “congrats,
you’re in!”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figure that if I publish my submissions here, perhaps a few
people might take a look and chip in some valuable thoughts. And
even though &lt;a href="/comments/"&gt;this site doesn’t do comments&lt;/a&gt;, I am
counting on Twitter and other social networks to spark some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you run a small conference or meetup that I don’t know about,
    I want to give you the opportunity to reach out to me if there’s a
    topic you’d like to hear me talk about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s generally far more topics that I’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to do talks on —
and feel reasonably qualified to — than what I often get selected
to speak about. In addition, there are &lt;em&gt;just so many&lt;/em&gt; conferences
and meetups out there that it’s impossible to keep track of all of
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you find a topic here that you’d really like at &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt;
event that I absolutely don’t have on my radar, do drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you find any of my talk ideas useful, go ahead and submit your
   own talk like it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re a leader in tech, you don’t get to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The excellent &lt;a href="https://joshsimmons.com/"&gt;Josh Simmons&lt;/a&gt; recently
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshsimmons/status/1111292871594774529"&gt;implored people on
Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
to stop using the term “non-technical” when talking about another
person’s skill set. And as far as that term is often used as a
put-down of others, I am &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; with Josh. Belittling someone
because they work in documentation, corporate leadership, marketing,
middle management, PR, advocacy, legal (etc. etc.), and because you
consider yourself somehow superior because you’re in a “technical”
role — that has got to stop, yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I would like to amend his plea to also decry the use of the
phrase &lt;em&gt;about oneself,&lt;/em&gt; as a cop-out. I am talking about people in
leadership roles saying “I’m not technical” or “I’m not a tech
person” to allege that they have bigger fish to fry, and cannot be
reasonably &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; to understand technical detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that has to stop yesterday, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership roles exist that &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; understanding of technical
detail.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re the CEO of a tech company, you need to understand
the technology your company makes. If you’re in charge of a product,
you need to understand the technology that makes up that product. And
even if your company’s core business has nothing to do with
technology, but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are in charge of something that does, you need
to understand that technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course it’s nigh impossible to understand every bit of
technology that you need to make decisions on, in its every intricate
detail. But you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be faced with decisions that do boil down to
&lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; technology details. And then, it is incumbent on you to
know as much as you need to know, to make an &lt;em&gt;informed&lt;/em&gt; decision. This
is a core element of a leadership position, and it makes up at least
part of your income differential versus a person who is a subject
matter expert in their field, but doesn’t manage other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whenever you have an issue to decide on that you don’t understand,
get someone to explain it to you.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s perfectly fine to say “I know
nothing about this bit of technology, please give me your simplest
explanation that will enable me to make a decision.” But you don’t get
to say “I’m not a technical person” and use that as a pass for, and
perpetuation of, your self-inflicted ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(By the way, the same is obviously true in reverse. Say you’ve got the
tech-person perspective and someone from legal comes up to you with a
question on licensing or patents or international contract law that
you know zilch about? Same thing. “Please give me your simplest
explanation of this matter that will enable me to make a decision.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a recently popular spin on the “it’s OK to be non-technical”
cop-out argument, which is to over-emphasize communication skills over
tech skills. It starts with a truism — a person’s technical skills
provide little benefit unless paired with communications
proficiency. But then this is frequently flipped to claim that
technical understanding can be &lt;em&gt;replaced&lt;/em&gt; with communications skills,
because the former allegedly &lt;em&gt;pales&lt;/em&gt; in importance versus the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me break something to you: &lt;strong&gt;except in the rare case of a job
where someone works entirely on their own and also has no customers,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
communication skills are &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; person’s most important skills.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes of
course&lt;/em&gt; your communication skills are more important than your tech
skills, because they’re literally more important than
anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;if you’re a great communicator but you don’t know what
you’re talking about, all that makes you is a bullshit peddler.&lt;/strong&gt; And,
if you’re actually incapable of listening to experts who are able and
usually very willing to explain a complex matter to you, maybe you’re
not such a grand communicator after all, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re in a leadership position that is even remotely
tech-related, and you’ve ever used “I’m not technical” as a free pass
to not understand things, stop. It isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I am aware that this is exceedingly rare. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a misconception. I’ll be happy to explain, requiring — I
promise! — no technical understanding of what an upload filter is, or
how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current draft of the EU Directive “on copyright and related
rights in the Digital Single Market”, available
&lt;a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2018-0245-AM-271-271_EN.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
(PDF in English), also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market"&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;EU Copyright
Directive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
requires in its Article 17 (formerly Article 13), clause 4, that the
service provider undergoes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in accordance with high industry standards of professional
diligence, best efforts to ensure the unavailability of specific
works and other subject matter for which the rightholders have
provided the service providers with the relevant and necessary
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that the only way any platform hosting
user-generated content would thus have to intercept any such content
&lt;em&gt;on upload,&lt;/em&gt; failing which it would immediately become potentially liable for a
copyright violation. This would require a technical facility commonly
called an &lt;em&gt;upload filter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We don’t need to talk about how upload filters &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, an upload filter is immensely complex and there are tons of
technical difficulties — the only time this has been attempted on a
large scale is YouTube’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_ID_(algorithm)"&gt;Content
ID&lt;/a&gt;, and it is
exceedingly unreliable and prone to overblocking. But for the purposes
of this discussion, it doesn’t matter whether implementing an upload
filter is difficult to do.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume for a moment someone has built a magnificent upload
filter. Something that operates on magic pixie dust that catches &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;
copyright violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s call every instance of someone uploading content to the
internet an “interaction”. Every tweet, every Facebook post and
comment, every comment on your favorite news site, every blog post you
write, every picture that you take and post to a WhatsApp group of 50
people or more, every YouTube video and comment — let’s call all of
those “interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let’s make an outrageously overblown assumption: suppose that on
the internet today, 1% of such interactions infringe someone’s
copyright. Again, let me reiterate that this is ludicrously high. The vast
majority of internet interactions today are either completely trivial
and thus irrelevant to copyright, or works of your own, or a perfectly
legal fair-use way of using someone else’s work, such as when you
quote a passage of a book. But purely for the sake of this discussion,
let’s say it’s 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then let’s look at 10,000 interactions that completely random
people make on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those would then break down like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table-striped table"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Total&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Perfectly legal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,900&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Infringing copyright&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Catching copyright violations. Or non-violations.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. Now, suppose we built a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; upload filter, i.e. one that
catches &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; copyright infringements. Remember, the Directive calls
for “best effort to ensure the &lt;strong&gt;unavailability&lt;/strong&gt;” (emphasis mine) of
potentially infringing content. It does not allow providers to balance
for freedom of expression or the like, so to err on the side of
caution, they must strive to over- rather than underblock. So a
perfect filter is one that has &lt;strong&gt;no false negatives&lt;/strong&gt; — meaning if
content infringes, it is always caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose further that the filter mis-identifies content (meaning,
flags content as infringing when it is not) with a rate of only
2%. That means it has &lt;strong&gt;2% false positives.&lt;/strong&gt; That, now, is
ridiculously low for any automated screening procedure.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that means that out of our 10,000 interactions tracked by our
“perfect” content filter, the numbers break down like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table-striped table"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Total&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Flagged as legal&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Flagged as infringing&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Perfectly legal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,900&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,802&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;198&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Infringing copyright&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,802&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;298&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Congratulations, a coin toss beats your upload filter.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads us to the question: if you upload something and it gets
flagged, how likely is it that it is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; infringing any
copyright? Answer: 100 in 298. Roughly one in three. &lt;strong&gt;Yes, that is
worse than a coin toss.&lt;/strong&gt; And remember, this is assuming an
implausibly high rate of infringements overall, and a ludicrously low
false-positive and false-negative rate on your filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and play with the numbers, tweak the false-negatives and
false-positives, whatever. &lt;strong&gt;As long as what you’re looking for is
exceedingly rare, automated filters detect it with poor accuracy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you leave all parameters the same, but consider a probably much
more realistic infringement rate of 1 in 1000, that is, 0.1%, then
things look like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table-striped table"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Total&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Flagged as legal&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Flagged as infringing&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Perfectly legal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,990&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,800&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Infringing copyright&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,800&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;300&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s a one-in-thirty chance that an upload block is
legitimate. Assuming there is an appeals process, and all false
positives get appealed, then that means the &lt;strong&gt;human&lt;/strong&gt; going through
the appeals will have to undo a block &lt;strong&gt;29 times out of 30.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A cheap optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to propose an optimization here: any website seeking to
implement a content filter should consider to just use a &lt;strong&gt;random
number generator to reject your upload, comment, tweet, or post with a
certain probability that is demonstrably larger than that of an upload
filter.&lt;/strong&gt; I’d posit that that would be by far the safest, cheapest way
to comply with the directive — if it becomes law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, everyone who is now in favor of this directive (including
its Article 17) will hate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also easy to dismiss with a “try harder”
retort, which is completely disingenuous, because it’s akin to
saying, doc, this patient has terminal pancreatic cancer, but you
&lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; cure her. Inoperable? Terminal? No there’s &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; to be a
way. Sometimes there is no way, and it’s OK when an expert tells
you that. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, yours.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, March 26 at half-past noon Central European Time, the
European Parliament is due to vote on an issue that will definitely
impact your life, no matter if you live in or outside the EU. No, it
has nothing to do with Brexit. Brexit has just managed to monopolise
your attention. The Tuesday vote has much more far-reaching
consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s going on here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the EP will vote on a Directive “on copyright and related
rights in the Digital Single Market”, the draft of which you can look
up
&lt;a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2018-0245-AM-271-271_EN.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
(PDF in English), also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market"&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;EU Copyright
Directive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this thing attempts to be a 21st-century copyright law, which is
laudable, but it does absolutely awful things: go take a look at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/CyUh9wOp_Rw"&gt;this
video&lt;/a&gt; to get the quick run-down. It’ll
only take 4 minutes of your time. And as you’ll see from the video,
&lt;strong&gt;this law will have a devastating global impact&lt;/strong&gt; on society at
large. (While completely failing to achieve its ostensible goals, mind
you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is apparent from the discussion around this directive is that it
isn’t being pushed by exceptionally clueful people. One MEP in favor
of the directive once publicly surmised that he was dealing with a
concerted campaign from Google, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schulzeeuropa/status/1096445520770404352"&gt;because lots of the email in his
inbox came from &lt;code&gt;gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;
addresses&lt;/a&gt;. The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committees_of_the_European_Parliament"&gt;rapporteur&lt;/a&gt;
on the directive &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/de/article/vbw8zy/streit-um-uploadfilter-und-artikel13-wie-axel-voss-das-internet-sieht"&gt;hasn’t subscribed to any YouTube channel and thinks
that there is a Memes section on
Google&lt;/a&gt;,
and when properly roasted on Twitter, someone representing
his party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDU_CSU_EP/status/1108372306101968901"&gt;publicly doubled
down&lt;/a&gt; on
his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of Janus Kopfstein:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pggamb/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works-5886b6cbc860fd45c9f2dfe3"&gt;It’s no longer OK to not know how the internet
works.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, he wrote that in 2011, and addressed at the U.S. Congress, but
here we are, with our European representatives still needing that
reminder 8 years on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even tried the oldest trick in the book: once all of Europe
started screaming about Article 13, they renumbered. So &lt;strong&gt;what used to
be Article 13 is now Article 17.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t get confused; this is just a
ploy by people who print out emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now luckily, the backers of Article 17 are opposed by a good bunch of
people who are clued in, and have pledged to strike this Directive
down in the EP on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OK. So what do I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet"&gt;sign a change.org
petition&lt;/a&gt;. It
already has 5 million supporters, and there will likely be many
more. But supporting that petition &lt;strong&gt;is not enough.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out your own MEPs for their status at &lt;a href="https://pledge2019.eu/"&gt;Pledge
2019&lt;/a&gt;. And you can lean on them: Pledge 2019
lets you call the people whose job it is to represent &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; in the
EP, and if they haven’t pledged to reject the Directive in its current
form, &lt;strong&gt;you can let them know&lt;/strong&gt; (in no uncertain terms) &lt;strong&gt;that you
won’t be voting for them or their party in the upcoming &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Parliament_election"&gt;EP
elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there’s &lt;a href="https://saveyourinternet.eu/act/"&gt;Save Your
Internet&lt;/a&gt;. The primary spin your
pro-upload filter reps are trying to put on the discussion is that
the legislation isn’t opposed by an appreciable number of real people,
and that only astroturfing bots want this law struck down. You can
&lt;strong&gt;write an email, send a letter&lt;/strong&gt; (yes, a letter, as in, snail mail), or
&lt;strong&gt;call them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But with little kids in the house, that’s a nontrivial endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked exclusively from home&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the last 6½ years, and
when I first started, my older kids were 7 and 6 years old. For the
last 3 years after the arrival of our two younger children, though,
I’ve worked from home &lt;strong&gt;with infants/toddlers in the house,&lt;/strong&gt; and
that’s a wholly different ball game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The basic rules of working from home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve dealt with the idea of working from home, or have
done it before, then you’re surely familiar with a few basic rules to
follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you have a &lt;em&gt;home office,&lt;/em&gt; that is a working space to
  yourself that allows you to close a door and be undisturbed when you
  need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set aside some time to go outside. Office workers have a commute
  that ensures they get out of the house; as a home worker you’re
  running a certain risk of turning into a hermit. Make sure you run
  errands, take walks, go for runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep tabs on your working hours. Home workers are frequently at risk
  of working too much or too long, which puts a strain on yourself,
  your significant other, and your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintain relationships with others who work from home. Chat with
  them, call them, invite them over for dinner if they live close
  by. Working from home is still not a common thing to do in general
  (however common it might be in the tech industry), so exchanging
  thoughts with people in the same boat is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be ready to try out working-from-home strategies that have worked
  for others. Fortunately for all of us, there are quite a few people
  who talk about the experience publicly — for example,
  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johndalton"&gt;John Dalton&lt;/a&gt; did so in a
  &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/qFWkDPTjjEM"&gt;45-minute talk&lt;/a&gt; at linux.conf.au
  2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now, the challenging part: &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; kids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone reading this wants to pre-emptively freak out and berate me
for being an irresponsible or unloving parent, you are politely asked
to chill and if incapable of doing so, to GTFO. I absolutely love
being around my children, and I wouldn’t even &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; to trade my job
for an office-dwelling one. Being able to work from home is generally
a wonderful privilege, and so is being around my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to be aware of two things: one, working from home with a
family is different from working from home when you’re alone or living
with an adult partner or roomie. Two, working from home with a family
with little children is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different from a family with school-age
kids. School-age children don’t permanently need an adult in the room,
they spend a significant amount of their time outside the house,
they’re usually not particularly prone to tantrums, and in the event
that you really, really need some quiet, they can be asked to give you
that for a limited amount of time. Kids under two?  Good luck with
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not striking a balance here, here’s what’s likely to
happen: you’ll think that you are a completely inadequate parent, or a
terrible employee, or both. So, never lose sight of the fact that
you’re probably a wonderful parent and a highly productive employee —
but that you can do &lt;em&gt;anything,&lt;/em&gt; but not &lt;em&gt;everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most important piece of advice here is that you &lt;strong&gt;should not attempt
to &lt;em&gt;simultaneously&lt;/em&gt; be a primary parent and an employee.&lt;/strong&gt; (Please
note the emphasis on “simultaneously.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s fundamentally impossible to be a mindful parent of your
kids, and &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt; a productive knowledge worker. And the
repeated attempt will lead to frustration and burnout. Of course, you
can split your day in half with your significant other, if for example
you happen to be a night owl and they are not, and you can put in a
full day of work between 1pm and 9pm (but do ensure you get enough
sleep, which is probably a topic for another post). Or you could rise
early and start working at 6 while your other half drops your kids off
at daycare, from whence you pick them up at 2. But whatever it is that
you decide, please don’t fool yourself into thinking that you can work
productively, and be a good parent for your kids at the very same
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Productivity tips during work hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we’ve established that work time and parenting time shouldn’t
overlap. So what can you do while you’re at work, and your kids are in
the house (under the supervision of your spouse or partner, or other
trusted guardian)? Spoiler: “please, kids, be quiet for a bit” isn’t
going to work. Not with toddlers. And sound-proofing your room is
quite expensive, and also remarkably ineffective for the deep bass
&lt;em&gt;whooomp&lt;/em&gt; of an exuberant kid jumping off a couch upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself being able to focus extremely well if I &lt;strong&gt;play
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise"&gt;pink noise&lt;/a&gt; through my
headphones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It drowns out practically all background noise, and
is uniform enough that my brain eventually drops it as an input, and I
barely notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also habitually &lt;strong&gt;close my door&lt;/strong&gt; when I need to work. Obviously, my
family knows that they can call on me when something urgent comes up,
but little kids rightfully take an open door as an invitation. And as
much as I would like to be able to tolerate interruptions of my
thinking flow to play with a little one for a few minutes, and then
immediately pick up where I left off,
&lt;a href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/"&gt;I am not.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
So, this is a classic trade-off: I can either enjoy the interaction
with my kids and then deal with the frustration that comes with not
getting things done, or I can get things done and regret that I didn’t
spend more time with my kids. There’s no right answer. The wrong
answer that I choose is that my door stays closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Striking a balance (or trying to)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things I do to try and balance my in-house family
absence (I’m dead serious, that’s what working from home is):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m home, &lt;strong&gt;I don’t miss lunch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I can’t say that I’ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;
  missed lunch because I have done so when a customer’s or colleague’s
  environment had just reached the
  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire"&gt;HCF instruction&lt;/a&gt;,
  but I won’t miss lunch for a meeting that can also be scheduled to
  an hour earlier or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;tucking the little ones in&lt;/strong&gt; is my job every night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t travel when it would mean being absent for a child’s
  birthday.&lt;/strong&gt; Which is actually not that easy to do when you’re on the
  conference circuit, travel about 100 days per year, and you have a
  big family — thus far, if my math is right I’ve successfully
  navigated 28 kids’ birthdays.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I succeeding?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be real: &lt;strong&gt;I have no way of knowing.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether I’m being a
decent parent will ultimately be judged by my children when they’ve
grown up. Whether I’ve had a successful career is something I’ll
decide upon my retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, such is life. And thus far it looks like I don’t
suck at it. I hope. 🙂 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; from home. Throughout the last few years I’ve
traveled rather extensively, so I’ve also worked from planes,
airport lounges, trains, hotel rooms, customer offices, cafes and
parks. What I mean is that I haven’t had to go to an office on a
daily basis, since 2011. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hat tip to
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)"&gt;David Allen&lt;/a&gt;,
whose &lt;a href="http://a.co/iZhglcP"&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; is not the
ultimate fount of all self-management wisdom, but definitely a
good source to have read at least once. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Linux box with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX"&gt;SoX&lt;/a&gt;,
you can generate an Ogg Vorbis file containing 25 minutes of pink
noise with
&lt;code&gt;sox -n pinknoise.ogg synth 25:00 pinknoise&lt;/code&gt;
— the 25-minute length may come in handy if you’re using
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/a&gt;. As
with music, I play my pink noise from
&lt;a href="https://audacious-media-player.org/"&gt;Audacious&lt;/a&gt; with the
&lt;a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/"&gt;MPRIS&lt;/a&gt;-2
plugin enabled, which allows me to pause and play from
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell"&gt;gnome-shell&lt;/a&gt; with the
&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/"&gt;Media Player Indicator&lt;/a&gt;
extension. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not consider myself a programmer. But the issue described
in the cartoon applies to any knowledge worker. In fact, it
probably applies to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; worker, it’s just that I’ve been doing
knowledge work for the entirety of my career, and can’t comment
authoritatively on anything else. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who grew up outside central Europe: over here,
lunch (not dinner) is traditionally considered the “big” meal of
the day. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took uninterrupted travel breaks of 6 and 10 weeks,
respectively, when our younger kids were born. (When the older
ones arrived, I was traveling way less overall, so those travel
schedule adjustments were easy at the time.) &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is time to stop considering it a viable method for building software.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a writeup of an
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)"&gt;Ignite&lt;/a&gt; talk I gave at
&lt;a href="http://www.openstack-israel.org"&gt;OpenStack Israel 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_____&lt;/code&gt;‘s roles, artifacts, events, and rules are &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; and
although implementing only parts of &lt;code&gt;_____&lt;/code&gt; is possible, &lt;em&gt;the result
is not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;_____&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see a statement like this and wonder what should be filled in
for the blanks, it’s rather quite likely that you would guess either a
radical political ideology, a very strict religious sect or cult, or
something to that effect. You couldn’t be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Scrum&lt;/code&gt;‘s roles, artifacts, events, and rules are &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; and
although implementing only parts of &lt;code&gt;Scrum&lt;/code&gt; is possible, &lt;em&gt;the result
is not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;Scrum&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s a
&lt;a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#end-note"&gt;direct quote from the Scrum guide.&lt;/a&gt;
Scrum, by its own definition, can either be implemented completely —
that is, with all its roles, artifacts, events, and rules &lt;em&gt;unchanged&lt;/em&gt;
— or not at all. This sounds ludicrous enough as it is, and any sane,
thinking person should reject or at least resent &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; such statement
outright. But let’s give Scrum the benefit of doubt, and let’s
actually start examining some of its postulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teams are self-organizing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum hinges on the idea that teams are comprised of capable
individuals forming teams, which then self-organize. Now I’m sure
nobody would argue that self-organizing teams cannot exist, so this
postulate does not invalidate itself outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is missing an important prerequisite: teams can
self-organize &lt;strong&gt;if they are stable.&lt;/strong&gt; And team stability is a
precondition that almost never exists in the software industry: our
industry is &lt;em&gt;growth-oriented,&lt;/em&gt; and driven by quickly-growing startups,
so in a successful organization having a new colleague every other
month is not unheard of. It is also highly &lt;em&gt;competitive&lt;/em&gt; for talent,
so having a colleague leave every few months isn’t unusual either. The
moment a new person joins or leaves, you have a new team. Team
stability goes out the window, and with it any reasonable expectation
of self-organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprint after sprint after sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scrum Guide explicitly states that every &lt;em&gt;sprint&lt;/em&gt; (a time frame of
one month or less, in which the team completes objectives agreed to
for the sprint backlog) is &lt;em&gt;immediately followed by the next sprint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mind-bogglingly ludicrous and outright dangerous to your
team’s mental health. Software development is a marathon, and running
a marathon as an unbroken series of sprints leads to collapse or
death. In software development, it’s likely to cause burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Daily Scrum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Scrum’s immutable events is the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Guide
defines this event as a specific, daily occurrence, time-boxed to 15
minutes and involving the entirety of the development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is staggeringly out of place in the modern development team,
which may well be spread out over multiple offices and timezones, and
may not even physically be in one place more than a handful of times a
year. Even in the unlikely event that everyone &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get together in
one room for precisely fifteen minutes each day, have you ever been in
a meeting involving more than 3 people that got anything accomplished
in 15 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, 15 minutes. Time-boxed, immutable. If you think &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt;
Daily Scrum can be 30 or 45 minutes, or you can do it just every other
day or maybe thrice a week, recall: if you do that, you’re no longer
doing Scrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No planning beyond the current sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum is quite emphatic that the only thing developers should be
really concerned about in terms of planning is the next 24 hours (the
plan for which is ostensibly being laid out in the Daily Scrum), and
beyond that, the current sprint at a maximum. Now, while the idea of
freeing people’s minds and allowing them to focus on a single task at
hand is certainly laudable, the practical implications of having no
medium to long-term planning is insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d venture a guess that an approach where no planning is for more
than a month out is viable, under one condition: having exactly zero
users and/or customers for the product you are developing. I leave it
to you to decide how valuable it is, then, to develop the product in
the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permanent emergency mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably, some of the methods proposed in Scrum are quite suitable for
emergency situations. In a situation where you need to come up with a
solution that requires creativity, hustle, and speed, you may well sit
down, put down a requirements list, elect a coordinator and
spokesperson for your team, and just start hacking. I’d fully agree
that such situations can be extremely challenging, and quite
satisfying to come out of with flying colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if your organization is permanently operating in this mode,
&lt;strong&gt;quit.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn’t matter which role you’re in: as a developer,
you’re headed for burnout. As a manager, you’re herding your team into
burnout. Either way, you shouldn’t be doing this job, either in your
own interest or in that of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Novelty?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum proponents frequently argue in its favor as the antithesis of
the obsolete waterfall model, where all deliverables are defined from
the outset and there is no room for deviation, leading to products
that are either broken, or outdated, or both the moment they are
completed. If you think we only found out recently that waterfall is
bad, you’ve been asleep at the switch for over 30 years. In his
seminal
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"&gt;Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;
essay collection from 1975, Fred Brooks pointed out some weaknesses of
this model, and in his 1986 follow-up
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet"&gt;No Silver Bullet,&lt;/a&gt; he
proposes organic, incremental software development as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your team can’t work with Scrum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum advocates frequently argue that if Scrum doesn’t work with your
team, chances are that your team is the problem. This means that you
should either replace them, or at least educate them in the ways and
means of Scrum, so they can become a better-performing team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, it should be fairly obvious that if Scrum doesn’t work
for your team, the problem is not your team. The problem is Scrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if Scrum doesn’t deliver?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, Scrum proponents usually argue that if Scrum fails to
deliver adequate results in your organization, it’s likely because you
aren’t applying its central tenets correctly. In other words, you must
come to your senses, and implement Scrum as designed, and which point
results with magically appear, and your team will be in a constant
state of flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nonsense. &lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt; you were able to actually do Scrum (meaning
in its pure, immutable, One True Way), it would surely lead to
disaster. But, it’s impossible to do so anyway, so go ahead and ditch
it — stop being a scrumbag.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&amp;rsquo;s what you can do to avoid it, and instead adopt a container management pattern that will preserve your sanity and enable you to react to critical issues in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a writeup of &lt;a href="http://sched.co/3xVu"&gt;a presentation&lt;/a&gt; I did at
LinuxCon Europe in Dublin last year. Since Linux Foundation Events
&lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don’t come with video recording for all talks (all they do
record and publish are keynotes), I can’t point you to a YouTube link,
though you’re certainly welcome to
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/manageable-application-containers/"&gt;peruse my slides&lt;/a&gt;
from that talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you’re an operator who, in a massively scaled-out and highly
automated deployment, is responsible for keeping a few hundred or a
few thousand containers up and running. Your developers put those
together and then basically throw them over the wall for you to
manage. It’s your job just to keep them alive, available, and secure;
what’s &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; them is your developers’ domain. Sure, you have Git repos
you build your containers from, and a Docker registry, so you can
always check what’s in which container. You don’t get to call the
shots, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose further that all most of your containers run some form of web
service. And let’s assume, just for the sake of this discussion, that
they’re all running Apache, because that’s your reference
platform. Your developers may be writing applications in Python or
Ruby or (shudder) PHP, but what all your apps have in common is that
you’ve settled on Apache as your reference platform. Your developers
can assume that with Apache, you, the ops person, know the boldface
cold, and you can give them an extremely stable, well-tuned platform
to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Apache is affected by some disturbing security vulnerability
that you must now fix in record time. Say, something affecting your
core SSL library or maybe even your C library. Sound familiar? Thought
so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The fix in a non-containerized world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so you must now fix OpenSSL or libc on all your systems in record
time before the anticipated exploit barrage rolls in. In a world
without containers, you’d rely on your trusted software source
(normally, your distro vendor) to provide you with a fixed package or
packages for the affected libraries. You would then roll those out via
your preferred software management utility, or system automation
facility, or unattended upgrade scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, you’d have a tense time until updated packages are
available, but once they are, things get fixed in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But what now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the deployment of containers comes, frequently, the notion that
packaging, package management, or dependency tracking is somehow a
terrible idea. Instead, you put everything you need into one container
image, deploy one container per service, and not worry about what a
&lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; service running on the same physical hardware might need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, that simplifies things. Your developer needs MySQL
configured a certain way, and some other app needs it differently?
Fine, they can put everything in their own separate containers,
binaries, libraries and all, problem solved. Storage is dirt cheap,
containers are efficient and produce little overhead. If they ever
need to change anything, say go from one MySQL point release to
another, then they just rebuild the container, you replace the old
build with the new one, fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now it’s not your developer who wants to change things, it’s &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;
who needs to deploy a critical fix.&lt;sup id="fnref:twitter"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:twitter"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so.. using GlibC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How’s re-imaging all of your
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/docker"&gt;@Docker&lt;/a&gt; images going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Josh Long (龙之春)
(&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman"&gt;@starbuxman&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman/status/700591322177019904"&gt;February 19,
2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you set out to rebuild a few hundred containers, or maybe a couple
of thousand, to get the issue fixed. In a perfect environment, you
have access to every build chain, know about every version of every
container in your area of responsibility, can pinpoint exactly which
are affected by the vulnerability, have an automated toolchain to
build and deploy them, have perfect documentation so you don’t need to
check back with any of your developers, so it doesn’t matter whether
any one is out sick, on vacation, or has left the company since they
deployed one of their, now potentially affected, services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, everyone works in such a perfect environment. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, even &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; a fix to your issue is already available, you
&lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; need to scramble to get it deployed, and deploying is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;
more complicated than in a world without containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this an inherent problem with containers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not. The problem isn’t with the fact that you’re using
containers, or with the specific container technology. &lt;strong&gt;The problem
is that everyone is telling you to use containers a certain way, and
from an operational perspective that way is wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; And it’s not even
“wrong but still better than all other options”, it’s just wrong. I
guess you could call it the Docker Fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the bad news. The good news is that there is a way that is
better, saner, and cleaner, and will make your life as an operator
&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier, while not being too hard on your developer friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what’s a better way?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use containers in a simpler, less flashy, less exciting
— in short, &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Define a core platform, or platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any organization worth its salt will select a handful of distributions
to build products and services on. Maybe it’s even just one, but let’s
assume you have several, say the latest Ubuntu LTS,&lt;sup id="fnref:ubuntu"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ubuntu"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the
latest CentOS, and the latest Debian. For each of these, you can
define an absolute bare-minimal list of packages. I can almost
guarantee you that none of your developers will care about a single
item on that list. A C library, a shell, an init system, coreutils,
NTP… chances are that you’ll run up a list of well over 100 core
system components that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; will be expected to keep secure; your
developers will take them all for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can take for granted, thanks to the tireless work of
packagers and distro vendors over years and years, is that you will
get timely security updates for all of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deploy your core platforms as often as you need&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploy these reference systems across your physical hardware. Deploy
as many as you need for all the containers you’re expected to run on
each platform. Do so in an automated fashion, so that you never have
to log into any of these systems by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use OverlayFS for your containers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS"&gt;OverlayFS&lt;/a&gt; is a union mount
filesystem that ships as part of the mainline kernel. With OverlayFS
you can do a few clever things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a read-only base filesystem with a writable overlay to create a
  read/write union mount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write to the union mount and only touch the overlay, leaving the
  base filesystem pristine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hide selected content in the base filesystem from the union mount,
  through the use of
  &lt;a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt"&gt;opaque directories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use one base filesystem with multiple overlays to create any number
  of separate read/write union mounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately make updates to the base filesystem known to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; union
  mounts, by simply remounting them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes OverlayFS extremely powerful when used together with
LXC. You define a bunch of overlay directories — one for each of
your containers —, and they can all share one base filesystem:
your host root filesystem.&lt;sup id="fnref:automount"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:automount"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the union mount becomes your LXC container’s root. It
automatically has read access to everything that is available on the
host, unless specifically hidden, and whatever it writes goes to the
overlay. When you discard a container, you delete the overlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a minimal example configuration for a container like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# For additional config options, please look at lxc.container.conf(5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Common configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/usr/share/lxc/config/ubuntu.common.conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Container specific configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.arch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;amd64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Network configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.network.type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;veth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.network.link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;lxcbr0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.network.flags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.network.hwaddr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;00:16:3e:76:59:10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Automatic mounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.mount.auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;proc sys cgroup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.rootfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;overlayfs:/var/lib/lxc/host/rootfs:/var/lib/lxc/mytestcontainer/delta0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lxc.utsname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;mytestcontainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the LXC userland presently enforces an OverlayFS base
directory to be in a subtree of &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/lxc&lt;/code&gt;. You can satisfy this
requirement by bind-mounting &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/lxc/host/rootfs&lt;/code&gt;, as
shown in the example above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this creates, among other things, is crystal-clear separation of
concerns: whatever is in the overlay is for your developers to
decide. They can pull in packages from PyPI, Ruby Gems, NPMs,
whatever. What’s in the host root is your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automate, automate, automate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious and self-evident, but it doesn’t hurt to reiterate: you
want to automate &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of this. You’re certainly free to select your
own tools to do it, but Ansible specifically has very good LXC
container support so it makes this a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple Ansible playbook example that creates 100 containers,
all based off your host root.&lt;sup id="fnref:ansible"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ansible"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;hosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Create a local bind mount for the host root filesystem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;/var/lib/lxc/host/rootfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;opts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;fstype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Create a template container using the host root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;lxc_container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;stopped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;/var/lib/lxc/host/rootfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;/var/lib/lxc/host/config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;container_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lxc.mount.auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;cgroup"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lxc.include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/usr/share/lxc/config/ubuntu.common.conf"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Create 100 OverlayFS based containers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;lxc_container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;backing_store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;overlayfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;clone_snapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;clone_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mytestcontainer{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;}}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;started&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;with_sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;count=100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course, this will also mean that you’ll need to get your
developers to define their container config in Ansible. However, that
is fundamentally a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing, because it means that developers and
operations people will be reading and writing the same language. Also,
if your developers can write a Dockerfile, they won’t have a hard time
with Ansible YAML either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does this help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this approach, think of what you now have to do to make hundreds
of containers running on the same box get a new libc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update your host libc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart your containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. That is literally all you have to do to update hundreds of
containers in one fell swoop. LXC will remount your OverlayFS on
container restart, and thus all changes to the host will be
immediately visible in the container’s overlay filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an Ubuntu platform, you could even go so far as automating this in
conjunction with unattended upgrades:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Automatically&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;upgrade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;packages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;these&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;origin:archive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pairs&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/05lxc&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Upgrade loads of containers in minutes. No
rebuild, no redeploy, nothing. Packaging actually does work and has
merit, regardless of what the hipster crowd is trying to sell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:twitter"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit, 2016-02-22: Added Twitter quote from Josh Long. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:twitter" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ubuntu"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, the latest Ubuntu LTS is 14.04 “Trusty
Tahr”, which is based on a Linux 3.13 kernel. This Ubuntu stock
kernel ships with a pre-release version of OverlayFS which
predates the 3.14 mainline merge. I would not recommend using that
kernel; instead you’ll want to run your hosts with a more recent
kernel from the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack"&gt;LTS Enablement Stack&lt;/a&gt;. Again
at the time of writing, this is a Linux 4.2 kernel that ships with
the &lt;code&gt;linux-generic-lts-wily&lt;/code&gt; package. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ubuntu" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:automount"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LXC containers do present per-container specific content for some
directories by default, notably &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/dev&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt;. Other
host-filesystem content can be hidden by creating opaque
directories in the container overlay; this is what you would
commonly do for directories like &lt;code&gt;/root&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; and
others. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:automount" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ansible"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that it’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as simple as shown in the
Ansible example. You will want to provide some additional tweaks,
such as added mounts or opaque directories. I’ve tried to keep the
example brief to illustrate the concept. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ansible" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

We&amp;rsquo;ve been running its code base in production for several weeks, and can share some first-hand experience.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, the &lt;a href="https://open.edx.org"&gt;Open edX&lt;/a&gt; community
&lt;a href="https://open.edx.org/blog/newest-open-edx-release-dogwood-now-available"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;
its latest release,
&lt;a href="http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/open-edx-release-notes/en/latest/dogwood.html"&gt;Open edX Dogwood&lt;/a&gt;. (In
case you don’t follow the Open edX community closely, its releases are
alphabetically named after trees, so on the heels of the Birch and
Cypress releases, we now have
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornus_(genus)"&gt;Dogwood&lt;/a&gt;, and
Eucalyptus will be next.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team got involved in Open edX around the Cypress release
timeframe, and we shifted our OpenStack integration work to track the
master branch in December, to ensure we would be ready in time for
Dogwood. &lt;a href="//academy.hastexo.com"&gt;hastexo Academy&lt;/a&gt; also tracks master,
so if you take one of our self-paced online courses, you’ll be running
the latest and greatest from Open edX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checking out the new features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several new features in Open edX Dogwood, some of which we
tested and ran, with somewhat mixed (but generally positive) results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Platform upgrades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open edX now builds upon Django 1.8 and Python 2.7.10. It’s great to
see some technical debt pay-down by moving beyond the now-unsupported
Django 1.4. We hope to see this continue by Eucalyptus
&lt;a href="https://openedx.slack.com/archives/general/p1455215550000885"&gt;hopefully moving to the next Ubuntu LTS, 16.04 “Xenial Xerus”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be great to see a move to Python 3, but we’re not
holding our breath on that, for various reasons — including the fact
that Ansible, which Open edX uses for deployment, &lt;a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/661590/"&gt;also still requires
Python 2.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comprehensive theming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive theming is a new and improved way to apply theming and
branding to Open edX platforms, which will eventually replace the
current “Stanford” theming engine (named after an Open edX theme
developed at Stanford University, which became a popular basis for
rebranding the Open edX LMS). In mid-January, we shifted
&lt;a href="https://github.com/hastexo/edx-theme"&gt;our own Stanford-style Open edX theme&lt;/a&gt;
to Comprehensive Theming and test-deployed on hastexo Academy, then
still in pre-launch. We ran into a critical bug
&lt;a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/11319"&gt;that has been fixed for the release,&lt;/a&gt;
and will come back to redeploying our new Comprehensive theme at a
later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also waiting for a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/edx/configuration/pull/2676"&gt;patch to the &lt;code&gt;edx-configuration&lt;/code&gt; Ansible repository&lt;/a&gt;
to land, so we can properly deploy our Comprehensive theme to our Open
edX instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Otto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also looked extensively at the new Open edX ecommerce framework,
“Otto”, for buying and sellling course seats. Sadly, we found multiple
issues that prevented us from using it in our infrastructure for the
time being, and we pushed Otto off for our Eucalyptus respin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otto has no support for tax assessment on course seats; this is a show
stopper for anyone who wants to sell courses to people in Europe, as
course seats are Digital Goods under EU VAT regulations and require
VAT assessment. We were admittedly a little dismayed to find that Otto
had made some design decisions that made this impossible to fix in the
way you would normally do this in the
&lt;a href="http://django-oscar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; framework that
Otto builds on. Fixing Otto in-place would likely have delayed our
Academy launch by several months, so that was a delay we were
unwilling to accept. There are other issues with Otto, notably the
fact that it comes with its own PayPal integration (as if
&lt;a href="http://django-oscar-paypal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;django-oscar-paypal&lt;/a&gt;
didn’t exist), which made us rather uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we instead integrated hastexo Academy with our own, pure-Oscar web
store that makes use of upstream community supported features much
more extensively than Otto, and that also enables us to sell other
products and services besides hastexo Academy course seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LTI XBlock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Dogwood release, the LTI XModule has been refactored into the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/edx/xblock-lti-consumer"&gt;LTI Consumer XBlock&lt;/a&gt;. While
we do not currently use this XBlock in production, it comes in very
handy as a good reference for
&lt;a href="https://github.com/edx/xblock-lti-consumer/tree/master/lti_consumer/tests/unit"&gt;XBlock unit tests&lt;/a&gt;,
which we’ll be using to improve the test coverage in our own XBlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open edX integration with OpenStack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our OpenStack integration work for Open edX is continuing at its
regular, steady pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Running Open edX Dogwood on OpenStack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re of course still able to deploy Open edX on OpenStack, using the
Heat templates we’ve maintained since Cypress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Running the hastexo XBlock on Open edX Dogwood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hastexo XBlock, enabling course authors to define arbitrarily
complex lab environments for courses with OpenStack Heat, is of course
fully supported for Open edX Dogwood. That’s exactly what you’re using
when speeding through interactive labs on hastexo Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Congrats, and thanks!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations are in order for the entire development community! Our
team at hastexo would like to extend a big thank-you to everyone who
made a contribution to this release.&lt;/p&gt;

edX&lt;/a&gt;, a trivial patch for an annoying issue in
the LMS start page. The PR is
&lt;a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/11138"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LMS component in Open edX is the stuff that actually provides a
learning platform to students, including the courseware itself, a
discussion forum, a wiki, and everything else you need for an
immersive learning experience. In our own &lt;a href="//academy.hastexo.com"&gt;hastexo
Academy&lt;/a&gt; environment, it of course also loads
the &lt;a href="//github.com/hastexo/hastexo-xblock"&gt;hastexo XBlock&lt;/a&gt; to interface
with arbitrarily complex, on-demand lab environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know how the LMS fits into Open edX overall, there’s
&lt;a href="//open.edx.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/open-edx-pages/edX_architecture_CMS_LMS_0.png" title="Open edX architecture diagram"&gt;an overview
graphic&lt;/a&gt; over at
&lt;a href="//open.edx.org"&gt;open.edx.org&lt;/a&gt; for your perusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a new contributor to Open edX, this obviously involves jumping
through &lt;a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst"&gt;yet another Contributor Agreement
process&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s
to hoping this gets resolved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update, 2016-02-03&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contributor agreement was &lt;a href="//github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/11138#issuecomment-168964638"&gt;squared away really
fast&lt;/a&gt;;
the patch review did, however, take some time. &lt;a href="//github.com/edx/edx-platform/commit/71a6779dfa44baa27d9c2b509587385edb4380af"&gt;But it’s in
now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

trek to &lt;strong&gt;linux.conf.au&lt;/strong&gt;, the largest open-source conference in the
Southern Hemisphere and one of my favorite conferences on the circuit.
LCA is an excellent, volunteer-run, hugely insightful conference and
well worth the 26-hour trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Perth in time to catch part of the Systems Administration
mini-conference on day 1. In particular, I caught a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwBdrvEXMk0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;systemd&lt;/strong&gt;
talk&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Rodger
Donaldson&lt;/strong&gt; which was both informative and entertaining, so I encourage
you to watch that when you get the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 had the OpenStack miniconf, which was good but a bit too focused
on OpenStack governance and organizational issues in its first half. In
the afternoon, talks got more technical, which was a clear improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday talks included a highly entertaining &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mQKyIAx6Mc"&gt;look at MySQL’s
history&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Stewart
Smith&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dave Chinner&lt;/strong&gt;‘s musings on where &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxZzSifuV4Q"&gt;Linux
filesystems&lt;/a&gt; came from, and
an insightful &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyDcYV9doL8"&gt;RADOS deep
dive&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Sage Weil.&lt;/strong&gt;
There was also a DRBD talk that I was not so fond of, but I’ve already
shared my thoughts about that one on Google+, and you’re certainly
welcome to &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FlorianHaas/posts/KTtvUzmATJM"&gt;take a
look&lt;/a&gt; over
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/YWVz1CSxayU"&gt;Rapid OpenStack Deployment for Novices and Experts
Alike&lt;/a&gt; tutorial was on Thursday, had a nice
turnout, and my hands-on stuff all worked! What more could I possibly
ask for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides my own talk, you should also totally watch &lt;strong&gt;Matthew Garrett&lt;/strong&gt;‘s
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixMStnFzgRM"&gt;Thursday keynote&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Lana Brindley&lt;/strong&gt;‘s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKmaCpOv0Ww"&gt;agile documentation tutorial with Lego
goodness&lt;/a&gt;. And of course,
my clear favorite among all LCA talks this year, Bdale Garbee’s
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7Et_eWJExU"&gt;reflections on losing his
house&lt;/a&gt; in a wildfire last
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Friday, again a stellar keynote from &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Oxer&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GHMTXiDqoA"&gt;Arduino
satellites in space&lt;/a&gt;, geek
overload), Lennart’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJyVaKZ8tbc"&gt;kdbus
talk&lt;/a&gt; which you’ve probably
already &lt;a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/580194/"&gt;read on LWN&lt;/a&gt; about, and a
brilliant &lt;a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2014/Friday/122-LCA_2014_-_Lightning_Talks_pt2_and_Thanks.mp4"&gt;lightning
talk&lt;/a&gt;
from Tim Serong about building a DIY bookscanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, linux.conf.au in Perth was terrific, as usual, and I am
absolutely planning to be there again next year. The trip will be even
more atrociuous as next year’s venue is
&lt;a href="http://lca2015.linux.org.au"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, but it will be totally worth
it. No doubt in my mind at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to extend a huge thank-you to all LCA attendees, fellow
speakers, organizers and volunteers who make this conference a fantastic
event year after year. See you in 2015!&lt;/p&gt;

There
are some interesting features in this new release, take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that will undoubtedly make Ceph a lot more palatable to
RHEL/CentOS users is the &lt;strong&gt;availability of Ceph in EPEL&lt;/strong&gt;. This was
&lt;a href="http://www.inktank.com/ceph/ceph-is-in-epel-and-why-red-hat-users-should-care/"&gt;originally announced in late
March …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, the developers released Ceph 0.61, codenamed cuttlefish. There

&lt;p&gt;One thing that will undoubtedly make Ceph a lot more palatable to
RHEL/CentOS users is the &lt;strong&gt;availability of Ceph in EPEL&lt;/strong&gt;. This was
&lt;a href="http://www.inktank.com/ceph/ceph-is-in-epel-and-why-red-hat-users-should-care/"&gt;originally announced in late
March&lt;/a&gt;,
but 0.61 is the first supported release that comes with Red Hat
compatible RPMs. Note that at the time of writing, EPEL is obviously
&lt;a href="http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/testing/6/x86_64/"&gt;still stuck on the 0.56 bobtail
release&lt;/a&gt;, but it
is expected that cuttlefish support will follow shortly. In the interim,
cuttlefish packages are available outside EPEL, &lt;a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/install/rpm/"&gt;on the ceph.com yum
repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows you to run a Ceph cluster on RHEL/CentOS. It does, however
come with a few limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t use RBD from a kvm/libvirt box that is running RHEL. RHEL
    does not ship with librados support enabled in the qemu-kvm builds,
    and removing this limitation would mean for third parties to provide
    their own libvirt/kvm build. As of today, tough, no RBD-support
    libvirt/kvm lives in &lt;a href="http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/CentOSPlus"&gt;CentOS
    Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t use the kernel rbd or ceph modules from a client that is
    running RHEL. RBD and Ceph filesystem support is absent from RHEL
    kernels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m curious to see if and when that will change, given Red Hat’s &lt;a href="http://www.gluster.org/2013/05/glusterfs-is-ready-for-openstack/"&gt;focus
on
GlusterFS&lt;/a&gt;
as their preferred distributed storage solution. It will be interesting
to see what happens there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another neat little new feature is the ability to &lt;strong&gt;set quotas on
pools,&lt;/strong&gt; which is something that we’ve frequently had customers ask for
in our consulting practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are &lt;strong&gt;incremental snapshots for RBD,&lt;/strong&gt; another really handy
feature for RBD management in cloud solutions like
&lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/openstack"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more, and you may head over to the press release and the Inktank
blog for more details. And then you might want to mark your calendars
for one of the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    24&lt;/a&gt;,

don’t like that, and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

being broadly applied to what we previously called a &lt;em&gt;community.&lt;/em&gt; I
don’t like that, and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the term &lt;em&gt;ecosystem,&lt;/em&gt; when applied to the environment in
which a software project is being developed, used and promoted, is
unknown, at least to the best of my knowledge. Some say that it was
&lt;a href="http://krow.net/" title="Brian Aker"&gt;Brian Aker&lt;/a&gt; who first spoke of “the
MySQL ecosystem”, and it seemed rather fitting at the time. Presently
though, it seems there’s ecosystems everywhere: the Linux ecosystem, the
OpenStack ecosystem, the Python ecosystem, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it annoys me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It annoys me not in the way marketing drone babbling annoys me, like
when someone waxes lyrical about synergies or paradigm shifts — that’s
the kind of fluff you automatically filter out and disregard, a bit like
page numbers in the slide decks of presenters stuck in the 20th century.
But the ecosystem thing is frequently used also by developers and users,
the actual movers and shakers, in the way we would previously use
&lt;em&gt;community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look for a moment at how a community works. A community is
governed by rules and morals. Those can be explicit, as written-down
laws, covenants or contracts. Much more commonly though, they are
implicit: everybody understands them, everybody is expected to abide by
them, and if you break them, you’re being shunned — but there’s no
requirement to write these rules down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about communities, most will naturally associate this with
a large group of people, like a clan or tribe, maybe a few hundred or
even a few thousand individuals. Puny, right? We need something grander,
something that alludes to hundreds or thousands of species with maybe
millions of individuals playing a part. Let’s pick a term: &lt;em&gt;ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;
Yay! Problem solved. Waaaay bigger than a community. So much more
awe-inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But guess what: &lt;strong&gt;an ecosystem is fundamentally amoral.&lt;/strong&gt; In an
ecosystem, there is no right or wrong — other than survival being right,
and if it happens to be at everyone else’s expense, that doesn’t make it
wrong. From the inside perspective of an ecosystem, if an invasive
species intrudes and steamrolls the entire habitat, so be it: it just
changed the ecosystem. Nature shrugs. Nature also shrugs at parasites,
disease, deception, camouflage, poison, and gangs of predators
collaborating with swift and deadly force to mercilessly kill a
defenseless herbivore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’re welcome to call me out on my naïveté, and point out that it
is precisely those things that happen in business every day. I am
acutely aware of that. I believe, however, we ought to consider them
evils, and some may consider them &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; evils at times. They
shouldn’t the foundations on which we build our &lt;em&gt;communities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_acts"&gt;Words matter.&lt;/a&gt; I think we
should use them wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

brief but excellent conversation with fellow OpenStacker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamspiers"&gt;Adam
Spiers&lt;/a&gt; from SUSE. Our chat turned to
the merits of working from home, and he encouraged me to write up a blog
post about some of the ideas of mine and of my co-founders’ which we
have since made hastexo policy, however informal or unwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that much of what follows aren’t necessarily original ideas of
ours. Many of my thoughts I owe to some very insightful chats I’ve had
over the past few months with the delightful &lt;a href="http://sarahnovotny.com/"&gt;Sarah
Novotny&lt;/a&gt;, original co-founder of &lt;a href="http://bluegecko.com/"&gt;Blue
Gecko&lt;/a&gt;, seasoned
&lt;a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012"&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt; conference chair and now CIO at
&lt;a href="http://meteor-ent.com/"&gt;Meteor Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. If you get a chance to
talk to Sarah at a conference and poll her views on this, I can highly
recommend you seize that chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with the observation that the separation of the place you
live in, and the place you work at, is a fairly recent concept in human
history. Prior to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution"&gt;Industrial
Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, which
originated in late 18th century England and steamrolled first Europe and
then the rest of the world, no such separation was common: the
blacksmith would live upstairs in his shop, so would the bakerman or the
butcher. The teacher would dwell, with his family, in the local school.
The farmer, and the farmhands, would live on that farm. In such a
setting it follows naturally that the work day spans essentially your
entire waking time: you would start your day’s work as soon as you got
up, and finished it when you retired for the night. It would be equally
natural to close the shop and interrupt your work for perhaps an hour at
a time, in order to consume a meal with your family or run an errand, or
to hold the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta"&gt;siesta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; common in
the Mediterranean to pass the hottest hours of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then with the Industrial Revolution, everything changed. In the name of
efficiency and progress, we decided that we had to pool workers in one
place — called a factory, or perhaps a shipyard — because now we needed
collaboration: one person could no longer fulfill the task alone, so we
had to get many people to one place to fulfill it together. And as a
natural continuation of our pre-industrial routine, people would work
ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week — until we realized that it
started messing up our lives, inflicting misery on our families and
social ties. And we invented a new concept called spare time: time we
could spend by ourselves, or with our families and friends, something we
didn’t have to ask for in the pre-industrial age when our work and life
would naturally have been integrated. And we gradually got to “advances”
like first the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_switchmen%27s_strike"&gt;10-hour&lt;/a&gt;
workday, then the 8-hour workday, then the 40-hour &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workweek"&gt;work
week&lt;/a&gt; when we decided it would be
better to have a rest of two days a week rather than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we invented white-collar, office jobs, and we gradually moved from
an industry-dominated to a service-dominated economy. And because by
this time we were all well trained in the rules of industrial life, and
because it had brought us progress and prosperity, we applied the same
concepts to offices that we previously had applied to factories and
shipyards: we would gather everyone in the same place, removed from home
and families, and we would get everyone to accept fixed “office hours”
when all hands would have to be present. Of course, we still needed to
collaborate, it’s just that the tasks differed from the ones we faced in
factories and shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the early 21st century, where we are suddenly endowed
with an abundance of readily available, cheap technology that allows us
to communicate and collaborate instantly, from almost anywhere. And it
is at this point that the unnatural split between work and non-work
life, which we inflicted upon ourselves during the Industrial Revolution
and which we have managed to rationalize with the brainwash that a
“clean separation” of “work and private life” is “essential” to
well-being — that has become a complete anachronism. It is no longer
vital for the people making up a company to physically be in the same
place to collaborate, to serve customers, and to be productive and make
a difference to communities. In fact, I consider it counterproductive.
We’ve finally arrived in a position where we can restore the very
natural way for humans to live and work, namely integrated with our
families, from home, connected through technology that enables us to
communicate just as effectively as sitting at the same desk. It also
enables us to live healthier, better lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m fully aware that this style of work is probably not for everyone.
But if you’re thinking it’s not for you (and I was one of those, until a
little over a year ago) it’s worth asking yourself &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re thinking
that. Is it really because you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to work in an office, or because
everyone has &lt;em&gt;told you&lt;/em&gt; for most of your career that you want to work in
an office?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at hastexo, it took us some time — several months — to figure out
all-electronic collaboration, but the machinery is working extremely
well now. The &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/"&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt;
stack has been enormously useful for us in that regard. We practically
live in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/"&gt;Google Hangouts&lt;/a&gt;
and documents shared on &lt;a href="http://drive.google.com"&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;. We jot
down ideas in Google Docs and sketch architectures in Google Drawings.
We do our weekly standups that way, and increasingly customer meetings,
too. We collaboratively draft and edit slide decks for training. And we
rehearse conference talks via video call. It just works, and it’s huge
fun that way. And it enables us to close our laptops and go read bedtime
stories to our kids when we’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

a deep dive into the Ceph stack. This is a double-slot tutorial,
scheduled for 2:45 - 4:25pm in the Verdi room.&lt;/p&gt;

Stack&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s also a 1-hour slot, from 10 - 11am in Vivaldi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty excited about this trip: it’s close to home, it’s a great

that sermon gets a bit of excess attention. Let’s take a quick look at
the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week of September 10, GitHub suffered a couple of outages which
caused a total downtime of 1 hour and 46 minutes, as
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jnewland"&gt;Jesse&lt;/a&gt; precisely pointed out &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/1261-github-availability-this-week"&gt;in a blog
post&lt;/a&gt;.
Exhibiting the excellent transparency that GitHub always offers at any
time its infrastructure is affected by issues (remember &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/1068-public-key-security-vulnerability-and-mitigation"&gt;their
role-model behavior in an SSH security
incident&lt;/a&gt;
a few months back), Jesse explains, in a very detailed way, what
happened on one of their Pacemaker clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all of what follows is based exclusively on the information in that
blog post of Jesse’s. I have no inside knowledge of the incident, so my
picture may be incomplete or skewed. But here’s my take on it anyway. I
do encourage you to read Jesse’s post full-length, as the rest of this
post otherwise won’t make much sense. I’ll just quote certain pieces of
it and comment on them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; nothing in this post should be construed as a put-down
of GitHub’s excellent staff. They run a fantastic service and do an
awesome job. It’s just that their post-mortem seems to have created some
misconceptions in the MySQL community about the Pacemaker stack as a
whole, and those I’d like to help rectify. Also, I’m posting this in the
hope that it provides useful insight to both the GitHub folks, and to
anyone else facing similar issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enable Maintenance Mode when you should&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the original post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday’s migration caused higher load on the database than our
operations team has previously seen during these sorts of migrations.
So high, in fact, that they caused Percona Replication Manager’s
health checks to fail on the master. In response to the failed master
health check, Percona Replication manager moved the ‘active’ role and
the master database to another server in the cluster and stopped MySQL
on the node it perceived as failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
At the time of this failover, the new database selected for the
‘active’ role had a cold InnoDB buffer pool and performed rather
poorly. The system load generated by the site’s query load on a cold
cache soon caused Percona Replication Manager’s health checks to fail
again, and the ‘active’ role failed back to the server it was on
originally.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
At this point, I decided to disable all health checks by enabling
Pacemaker’s &lt;code&gt;maintenance-mode&lt;/code&gt;; an operating mode in which no health
checks or automatic failover actions are performed. Performance on the
site slowly recovered as the buffer pool slowly reached normal levels.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s actually several issues in there even in this early stage.
Maintenance mode is generally the right thing to do here, but you enable
it &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; making large changes to the configuration, and you disable
it when done. If you’re uncomfortable with the cluster manager taking
its hands off the entire cluster, and you know what you’re doing, you
could also just disable cluster management and monitoring on a specific
resource. Both approaches are explained
&lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/resources/hints-and-kinks/maintenance-active-pacemaker-clusters"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as far as “health checks failing” on the master is concerned,
pretty much the only thing that is likely to cause such a failure in
this instance is a timeout, and you can adjust those even on a
per-operation basis in Pacemaker. But even that is unnecessary if you
enable maintenance mode at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Maintenance mode” really means maintenance mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning, our operations team was notified by a developer
of incorrect query results returning from the node providing the
‘standby’ role. I investigated the situation and determined that when
the cluster was placed into maintenance-mode the day before, actions
that should have caused the node elected to serve the ‘standby’ role
to change its replication master and start replicating were prevented
from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course. In maintenance mode, Pacemaker takes its hands off your
resources. If you’re enabling maintenance mode right in the middle of a
failover, then that’s not exactly a stellar idea. If you do, then it’s
your job to complete those actions manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I determined that the best course of action was to
disable &lt;code&gt;maintenance-mode&lt;/code&gt; to allow Pacemaker and the Percona
Replication Manager to rectify the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Best” might be an exaggeration, if I may say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A segfault and rejected cluster messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon attempting to disable &lt;code&gt;maintenance-mode&lt;/code&gt;, a Pacemaker segfault
occurred that resulted in a cluster state partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, that’s bad, but what exactly segfaulted? crmd? attrd? pengine? Or
the master Heartbeat process? But the next piece of information would
have me believe that the segfault really isn’t the root cause of the
cluster partition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this update, two nodes (I’ll call them ‘a’ and ‘b’) rejected
most messages from the third node (‘c’), while the third node rejected
most messages from the other two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s a pity that we don’t have any version information and logs, but
this looks very much like the “not in our membership” issue present up
to Pacemaker 1.1.6. This is a known issue, the fix is to update to a
more recent version (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/commit/03f6105592281901cc10550b8ad19af4beb5f72f"&gt;here’s the
commit,&lt;/a&gt; on
GitHub of course), and the workaround is to just restart the Pacemaker
services on the affected node(s) while in maintenance mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A non-quorate partition running MySQL?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having configured the cluster to require a majority of
machines to agree on the state of the cluster before taking action,
two simultaneous master election decisions were attempted without
proper coordination. In the first cluster, master election was
interrupted by messages from the second cluster and MySQL was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is an example of me being tempted to say, “logs or it didn’t
happen.” If you’ve got the default no-quorum-policy of “block”, and
you’re getting a non-quorate partition, and you don’t have any resources
with operations &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; configured to ignore quorum, then “two
simultaneous master election decisions” can only refer to the Designated
Coordinator (DC) election, which has no bearing whatsoever on MySQL
master status. Luckily, Pacemaker allows us to take a meaningful
snapshot of all cluster logs and status after the fact with crm_report.
It would be quite interesting to see a tarball from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second, single-node cluster, node ‘c’ was elected at 8:19 AM,
and any subsequent messages from the other two-node cluster were
discarded. As luck would have it, the ‘c’ node was the node that our
operations team previously determined to be out of date. We detected
this fact and powered off this out-of-date node at 8:26 AM to end the
partition and prevent further data drift, taking down all production
database access and thus all access to github.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s obviously a bummer, but really, if that partition is non-quorate,
and Pacemaker hasn’t explicitly been configured to ignore that, no
cluster resources would start there. Needless to say a working fencing
configuration would have helped oodles, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your cluster has no crystal ball, but it does have a command line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll skip over most of the rest of the GitHub post, because it’s an
explanation of how these backend issues affected GitHub users. I’ll just
hop on down to this piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automated failover of our main production database could be
described as the root cause of both of these downtime events. In each
situation in which that occurred, if any member of our operations team
had been asked if the failover should have been performed, the answer
would have been a resounding no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you could have told your Pacemaker of that fact beforehand. Enable
maintenance mode and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many situations in which automated failover is an excellent
strategy for ensuring the availability of a service. After careful
consideration, we’ve determined that ensuring the availability of our
primary production database is not one of these situations. To this
end, we’ve made changes to our Pacemaker configuration to ensure
failover of the ‘active’ database role will only occur when initiated
by a member of our operations team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That splash you just heard was the bath water. The scream was the baby
being tossed out with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated failover is a pretty poor strategy &lt;em&gt;in the middle of a large
configuration change.&lt;/em&gt; And Pacemaker gives you a simple and easy
interface to disable it, by changing a single cluster property. Failure
to do so may result in problems, and in this case it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you put a baby seat on the passenger side of your car, you disable
the air bag to prevent major injury. But if you take that baby seat out
and an adult passenger rides with you, are you seriously saying you’re
going to manually initiate the air bag in case of a crash? I hope you’re
not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, our operations team is performing a full audit of our
Pacemaker and Heartbeat stack focusing on the code path that triggered
the segfault on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s probably a really good idea. For anyone planning to do the same,
&lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/services/checkup"&gt;we can help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also the conference where I will be giving my fourth (and likely
last, at least for the time being) incarnation of the High Availability
for OpenStack talk I first delivered at the Folsom design summit back in
April. Since then, we’ve had a lot of community involvement for HA in
OpenStack, and have made some excellent progress, and I will be more
than happy to report on that. This presentation is on &lt;a href="http://cloudopen2012.sched.org/event/06939ee7fd5fe48bf202525bbd7e506d#.UDIX9hXwh2M"&gt;Thursday,

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://ceph.com/community/people-profile/sage-weil/"&gt;Sage Weil&lt;/a&gt;
of Ceph fame is joining me for an birds-of-a-feather (BoF) session on
Ceph. &lt;a href="http://rtrk.us/"&gt;Ross Turk&lt;/a&gt; and I had such an excellent turnout
(and a great time) in the Ceph BoF at OSCON that we just had to do
another. And Sage agreed to take part, which is excellent. He has &lt;a href="http://cloudopen2012.sched.org/event/f3e84388068b1855c5a705a97c917f44#.UDIZeBXwh2M"&gt;a

track&lt;/a&gt;
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference organizers do not announce BoF sessions ahead of time on
the CloudOpen web site, so I’ve simply &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cq28o7cvj9dg1ki1om3clfo8700/110443614427234590648"&gt;set up a Google+

to drive the Ceph stack, &lt;a href="http://www.inktank.com"&gt;Inktank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve previously blogged here, Ceph is &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/blogs/florian/2012/03/08/ceph-tickling-my-geek-genes"&gt;one of the most interesting
storage
technologies&lt;/a&gt;
out on the market today – and this includes both open-source and
commercial offerings. It’s exceptionally well designed, extremely
scalable, and useful for a frighteningly diverse set of usage scenarios.
Up to this point, Ceph development has been driven and funded by &lt;a href="http://newdream.net/"&gt;New
Dream Network&lt;/a&gt;, a long-standing hosting provider
operating out of Southern California since 1997 under the
&lt;a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/"&gt;DreamHost&lt;/a&gt; brand. Now, it’s being launched
into its own company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inktank is about to offer professional services and training around the
Ceph stack. I’ve had the pleasure to meet with Inktank President &amp;amp; COO
Bryan Bogensberger and others at the OpenStack conference in San
Francisco. Indeed, meeting with them was one of my motivations for being
there – besides &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/resources/presentations/reliable-redundant-resilient-high-availability-openstack"&gt;high availability in
OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;,
of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Inktank enables us to do is to remain involved in the Ceph
community even more than we previously were. We’re already offering Ceph
instruction as part of our &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/services/training/hastexo-high-availability-expert"&gt;High Availability
Expert&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/services/training/cloud-bootcamp"&gt;Cloud Bootcamp for
OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;
training classes. &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/who/martin"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; has
&lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/resources/presentations/glusterfs-und-ceph-skalierbares-storage-ohne-wenn-und-aber"&gt;presented Ceph at
CeBIT&lt;/a&gt;
in Germany this year. He has also just published a well-received
&lt;a href="http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/The-RADOS-Object-Store-and-Ceph-Filesystem"&gt;article on Ceph in the U.S. edition of ADMIN
magazine&lt;/a&gt;,
and I have another one coming up in next month’s Issue 218 of &lt;a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com"&gt;Linux
Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we’re excited for Inktank and wish them the best – even though we
sadly can’t be at their &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/always-bet-on-ink-tickets-3311680325"&gt;launch party in Las Vegas on May
8&lt;/a&gt;.
We appreciate the invitation, guys – have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

and am finally getting rid of my jet lag. Here’s a summary of what’s
been a mind-blowing conference experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first OpenStack Design Summit and Conference. And as anyone
who …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve just returned from the &lt;a href="http://www.openstack.org/conference/san-francisco-2012/"&gt;OpenStack Folsom Design Summit and Spring
2012
Conference&lt;/a&gt;,
and am finally getting rid of my jet lag. Here’s a summary of what’s
been a mind-blowing conference experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first OpenStack Design Summit and Conference. And as anyone
who’s in open source is acutely aware, some communities can be reluctant
to accept newcomers. Some may even seem outright hostile to the timid.
Not the &lt;a href="http://www.openstack.org/community"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute I sat down in the opening session of the Design Summit on
Monday, I felt instantly welcome and at home. Even as a relative
OpenStack newbie (who was invited to the Design Summit to provide some
insights and guidance on high availability), I immediately got the
impression that I was in the right place at the right time. I’ve rarely
seen a developer community on such a positive vibe. Sure, we’ll blast
each other on technical disagreements, but all in a good-natured, fun
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://folsomdesignsummit2012.sched.org/event/fa2a5803a4b4ba857db57c84a1e1d3bc"&gt;My own Design Summit
session&lt;/a&gt;
clearly wasn’t without such disagreements, and expectedly so. But I
think we came to some excellent conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure high availability will be an overarching design goal
    in the upcoming OpenStack Folsom release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will shoot for providing HA solutions for all OpenStack
    infrastructure services. This includes MySQL, RabbitMQ, Glance,
    Keystone, Nova and Horizon (Swift already has HA built in). hastexo
    will play a very active role in this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not reinvent the wheel, and instead rely on &lt;a href="http://clusterlabs.org/"&gt;the Pacemaker
    stack&lt;/a&gt; wherever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the challenge is really in the documentation and in the
    development of reference solutions that deployment solutions
    (&lt;a href="https://jujucharms.com/"&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.com/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;) can then build on. We will take a
    lot of responsibility in that effort, as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some services still require some work to become fully HA capable.
    Cinder (the volume service that’s being factored out of Nova for
    Folsom) is one example, Quantum is another. This work will be
    tackled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re currently planning to stop short of providing monitoring and
    HA for Nova instances (a.k.a. &lt;em&gt;guest HA&lt;/em&gt;). This is on the list for
    the next release past Folsom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those issues discussed, voted on and on the record, I had the honor
of &lt;a href="http://openstackconferencespring2012.sched.org/event/a6d940d2ebd11e37c6ac389f7d4d2125"&gt;presenting them to a larger audience at the main
conference&lt;/a&gt;.
It seems to have hit home pretty well, based on feedback from attendees
given in-person and on Twitter. &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;I’m hoping the conference
organizers will make a video recording available shortly. Meanwhile, my
presentation is already available

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just proposed a session for the &lt;a href="http://wiki.openstack.org/Summit/Folsom"&gt;OpenStack Folsom design
summit&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href="http://www.joinfu.com/"&gt;Jay
Pipes&lt;/a&gt; was nice enough to invite me to
(thanks!), and I thought I’d write up a few thoughts of mine ahead of
time to get the discussion started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while back, Tristan van Bokkem &lt;a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/openstack@lists.launchpad.net/msg07495.html"&gt;started a discussion on high
availability for
Nova&lt;/a&gt;
on the OpenStack mailing list. So in Nova specifically, there are a few
components where high availability is readily available; you just have
to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL. That’s a no-brainer. &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/resources/presentations/zen-pacemaker"&gt;MySQL HA with
    Pacemaker&lt;/a&gt;
    has been done so many times that I won’t rehash it here. What’s nice
    in this regard is that
    &lt;a href="http://galeracluster.com/products/mysql_galera"&gt;Galera&lt;/a&gt; (included
    in &lt;a href="http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtradb-cluster"&gt;Percona XtraDB
    Cluster&lt;/a&gt;)
    now promises to do away with the limitations of both
    &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/drbd"&gt;DRBD&lt;/a&gt; and traditional &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication.html"&gt;MySQL
    replication&lt;/a&gt;,
    and provide multiple-node, multiple-master &lt;em&gt;synchronous&lt;/em&gt; replication
    for MySQL. As I’m sure you’re aware, classic MySQL replication isn’t
    synchronous, and DRBD can’t do multi-node master-master, but the
    Galera based solution looks promising, &lt;a href="http://www.percona.com/blog/2012/01/09/announcement-of-percona-xtradb-cluster-alpha-release/"&gt;if not as mature as the
    other
    two&lt;/a&gt;.
    Of course, I don’t understand why the Galera folks had to reinvent
    not only replication (which makes sense) but also cluster membership
    and management (which doesn’t), but that’s a different discussion to
    be had altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RabbitMQ. Has somewhat similar HA considerations as MySQL. A
    Pacemaker/DRBD-based solution &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/pacemaker.html"&gt;exists, but is considered deprecated
    by the RabbitMQ
    maintainers&lt;/a&gt;. Enter
    &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html"&gt;mirrored queues,&lt;/a&gt; where again the
    developers seemingly threw out the baby with the bath water and
    rather than just reimplementing replication (sensible), they came up
    with their own cluster manager (questionable). Their mirrored queues
    would probably have played very nicely with master/slave sets in
    Pacemaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tom Ellis &lt;a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/openstack@lists.launchpad.net/msg07595.html"&gt;pointed out in another
email&lt;/a&gt;
the previously mentioned thread, there are more HA considerations for
services in Nova proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nova-volume still has a lot of work to do. It has an iSCSI
    &lt;a href="http://nova.openstack.org/api/nova.volume.driver.html"&gt;driver&lt;/a&gt;
    which can of course be used as an iSCSI proxy pointed at a highly
    available, potentially DRBD-backed, software iSCSI target. Or at an
    iSCSI based hardware solution that has HA built-in, such as HP
    LeftHand. Alternatively, we could just operate on RBD volumes (part
    of
    &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/blogs/florian/2012/03/08/ceph-tickling-my-geek-genes"&gt;Ceph&lt;/a&gt;)
    which will also take care of redundancy for us, and add seamless
    scaleout and remirroring. That being said, there is currently no
    real HA provision for the nova-volume service itself, and that’s
    something that will be required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute nodes can all run their own instance of nova-api.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front-end API servers can all run nova-scheduler, with a load
    balancer in front of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/high-availability/pacemaker"&gt;Pacemaker&lt;/a&gt;
stack has the potential of being a nice fit for most of the above. It
comes with &lt;a href="http://linux-ha.org/doc/man-pages/re-ra-iSCSITarget.html"&gt;iSCSI target
support&lt;/a&gt; (RBD
doesn’t need Pacemaker on the server end, as Ceph takes care of its own
HA). Pacemaker also ties in directly with upstart, so any upstart job
can be monitored as a Pacemaker service. And Pacemaker’s &lt;a href="http://clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/s-resource-clone.html" title="Don't balk at the XML! That's Pacemaker's reference documentation; any sane person would use the crm shell to manage Pacemaker resources in real life."&gt;clone
facility&lt;/a&gt;
makes it easy to run multiple instances of inherently stateless services
with minimal configuration. What’s more, Pacemaker comes with full
integration for the &lt;a href="http://horms.net/projects/ldirectord/"&gt;ldirectord&lt;/a&gt;
load-balancing service. Of course, Pacemaker adds a reliable
communications layer
(&lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/high-availability/corosync"&gt;Corosync&lt;/a&gt;)
and a multi-master, self-replicating configuration facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for non-Nova Openstack services, Glance could use some Pacemaker
integration (not hard to do; it’s just that someone has to do it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceph, in my opinion, has the very interesting potential of being a
redundant, scalable storage one-stop shop for OpenStack. It serves the
purposes of both volume/block storage (with RBD) and object storage
(with RADOS/radosgw). And, as already pointed out, it comes with HA,
replication, and scalability built-in.&lt;/p&gt;

User’s Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, I created the original &lt;a href="http://drbd.linbit.com/users-guide/"&gt;DRBD User’s
Guide&lt;/a&gt; several years back, and I
maintained it throughout my time at Linbit. &lt;a href="https://fghaas.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/on-to-new-endeavors/"&gt;When I left last
year&lt;/a&gt;, it
was originally mutually understood (or so I thought) that I could
continue to maintain it – as a non-employee, in a community capacity,
without compensation, just as it’s common in many other open source
projects. I tend to enjoy technical writing, and it was something I
certainly was looking forward to. And things got off to a promising
start, the first (trivial) patch to the documentation which I
&lt;a href="http://lists.linbit.com/pipermail/drbd-dev/2011-September/001684.html"&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt;
in my new life &lt;a href="http://git.drbd.org/gitweb.cgi?p=drbd-documentation.git;a=commit;h=35d41237aea064686ee21621b9fb1b9111a4424c"&gt;was quickly merged without
issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I made my
&lt;a href="http://lists.linbit.com/pipermail/drbd-dev/2011-November/001987.html"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="http://lists.linbit.com/pipermail/drbd-dev/2011-November/001999.html"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt;
submission to the documentation, the latter of which was a a bit more
elaborate, things got a bit strange. This was after hastexo went
operational, although whether that is at all related to the sequence of
events I don’t know. At any rate, I was being served with a
“Documentation Contributor License Agreement”. Which wasn’t considered
necessary in my earlier patch. Which involved copyright assignment.
Which I balked at. I don’t necessarily object to copyright assignment if
I write on a contract, as I occasionally do for technical magazines –
but what I wrote definitely hadn’t been contracted out to me. I had
simply submitted it unsolicited in the mere hope it was going to be
useful, and I wasn’t interested in contract work, either. In addition,
the documentation was (and is) under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"&gt;liberal CC-BY-SA
license&lt;/a&gt; which made any
copyright assignment unnecessary for a simple contribution. In my humble
opinion, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I raised these points, and my concerns were rejected, and my patches
didn’t make it in. Note, I have no quarrel with this at all – it may
well be a perfectly sane business decision. But that’s none of my
business anymore, and I respect their decision just fine. They have
stuck to their decision, and that is just fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only means that I don’t maintain the User’s Guide anymore, and I’m
evidently also unable to contribute patches, corrections or improvements
unless I consent to copyright assignment, which I disagree with in this
instance. So unless the policy changes at some point in the future, I
won’t be contributing to the User’s Guide any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name will remain in the authors list pretty much indefinitely (unless
someone publishes a complete rewrite) as that is required by law, but
you should interpret that as my being the original author – technically
a co-author, as I always made a point of crediting Lars’ and Phil’s
earlier work that the User’s Guide was based on. My co-authorship
doesn’t imply, however, that I’m a currently active author or
maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;

petascale storage stack? Well, you’ve really been missing out. It’s not
just a filesystem. It’s a filesystem, and a striped/replicated block
device provider, and a virtualization storage backend, and a cloud
object store, and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you will, by now, probably have heard of the Ceph filesystem, a
distributed, replicated, extremely scaleable filesystem that &lt;a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_34#head-87b23f85b5bdd35c0ab58c1ebfdcbd48d1658eef"&gt;went
upstream with the 2.6.34 kernel
release.&lt;/a&gt; But
that filesystem is really just a client to something that happens server
side, which is much more than just file storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ceph.com/category/rados/"&gt;RADOS&lt;/a&gt;, the reliable autonomic
distributed object store is a massively distributed, replicating,
rack-aware object store. It organizes storage in objects, where each
object has an identifier, a payload, and a number of attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects are allocated to a Placement Group (PG), and each PG maps to one
or several Object Storage Devices or OSDs. OSDs are managed by a
userspace daemon – everything server-side in Ceph is in userspace,
really – and locally map to a simple directory. For local storage,
objects simply map to flat files, so OSDs don’t need to muck around with
local block storage. And they can take advantage of lots of useful
features built into advanced filesystems, like extended attributes,
clones/reflinks, copy-on-write (with btrfs). Extra points for the effort
to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; reinvent wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire object store uses a deterministic placement algorithm, CRUSH
(Controlled Replication Under Scaleable Hashing). There’s never a
central instance to ask on every access, instead, everything can work
out where objects are. That means the store scales out seamlessly, and
can expand and contract on the admin’s whim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And based on that basic architecture, there’s a number of entry points
and deployment scenarios for the stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;radosgw&lt;/strong&gt; provides a RESTful API for dynamic cloud storage. And it
    includes an S3 and Swift frontend to act as object storage for
    AWS/Eucalyptus and OpenStack clouds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qemu-RBD&lt;/strong&gt; is a storage driver for the Qemu/KVM hypervisor (fully
    integrated with libvirt) that allows the hypervisor to access
    replicated block devices that are also striped across the object
    store – with a configurable number of replicas, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RBD&lt;/strong&gt; is a Linux block device that, again, is striped and
    replicated over the object store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;librados&lt;/strong&gt; (C) and &lt;strong&gt;libradospp&lt;/strong&gt; (C++) are APIs to access the
    object store programmatically, and come with a number of scripting
    language bindings. As you’ve probably guessed, Qemu-RBD builds on
    librados.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ceph&lt;/strong&gt; (the filesystem) exposes POSIX filesystem semantics built
    on top of RADOS, where all POSIX-related metadata is again stored in
    the object store. This is a remarkably thin client layer at just
    17,000 LOC (compare to GFS2 at 26,000 and OCFS2 at 68,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: it’s cool stuff. And it’s 100% open source, it’s all under the
LGPL 2.1, and the developers have made a point of not creating any
closed-source “enterprise” features – in short, they’re not shipping
“open core”.&lt;sup id="fnref:crippleware"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:crippleware"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve recently started contributing to the Ceph project to improve its
high-availability cluster integration: we’ve submitted Pacemaker
agents &lt;a href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/92cfad42030889d52911814faa717bebbd4dd22f"&gt;to monitor the Ceph daemons
proper&lt;/a&gt;
(a pretty trivial wrapper for a script that ships with Ceph, for now).
And we’ve also contributed &lt;a href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/c31b86963ab3c51b5c6d17f6e3222fe164ef3ee9"&gt;a resource agent to manage an RBD device
as a Pacemaker
resource&lt;/a&gt;.
The latter gives Pacemaker users the ability to use RBD devices as a
drop-in replacement for iSCSI devices, MD devices under Pacemaker
control, or DRBD. The Ceph community
has been exceptionally welcoming and has made contributing a
pleasure – there’s no copyright assignment nonsense, no CLAs, just a
very positive attitude toward outside contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you want to use a Ceph filesystem as a generally available
file system in your Pacemaker cluster (as you would with NFS, GlusterFS,
GFS2, or OCFS2), you can &lt;a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/resource-agents/commit/f93668b4b60682363a686a293810e34ad4088a47"&gt;do that now,
too&lt;/a&gt;.
However, please be cautioned that that should be considered an
experimental feature: the Ceph devs have made it very clear on numerous
occasions that they’re currently focusing on making RADOS and RBD rock
solid, and then they’ll tackle the POSIX filesystem layer to get it out
of experimental mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original version used the term &lt;em&gt;crippleware&lt;/em&gt; here,
  which I now consider highly inappropriate. (The term &lt;em&gt;open core&lt;/em&gt;, to
  the best of my recollection, wasn’t particularly current in 2012.) I
  would like to apologize for my use of the previous term. The article
  contains no other edits in comparison to the 2012 original. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:crippleware" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Expo as a speaker. Percona have picked up the torch that O’Reilly had
held as the conference organizers, and they’re putting together a 3-day
conference this year. I am co-presenting a tutorial with Yves Trudeau
from Percona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tutorial is called &lt;a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/mysql-high-availability-deep-dive-pacemaker-drbd-mysql-replication-and-more"&gt;High Availability Deep Dive: Pacemaker, DRBD,
MySQL Replication, and
more!&lt;/a&gt; and
it’s going to be the only full-day tutorial offered in this year’s
conference. In it, Yves and I are going to cover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    An overview of the Pacemaker cluster stack (the classic “this is
    Pacemaker” introduction)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;
DRBD-backed MySQL replication (another classic and widely deployed
scenario)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;
MySQL replication under Pacemaker management (a new option which
Yves has vastly improved through a big patch set to the MySQL RA).
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I expect this talk to be controversial? Definitely. The amount of
“Pacemaker is terrible” and “Pacemaker is unsuitable for managing highly
available databases” that has been around the blogosphere lately is
pretty mind-boggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strangely enough, most of the things brought forward against
Pacemaker by its detractors seem like a time-warp back to about 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    “We must use XML to manage Pacemaker!” Nonsense. In fact, that was
    &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; true – the release of Pacemaker as a separate project and
    the release of the crm shell coincided. Ever since, Pacemaker
    configuration has been as text-based as MySQL itself.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;
“All Pacemaker can do is react to node failure!” Nothing could be
further from the truth. Pacemaker has some of the most sophisticated
resource monitoring and auto-recovery capabilities under the sun.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;
“OK. But all it can do to react to &lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt; failure is kill a
daemon!” Bogus again. It will happily do whatever the resource agent
specifies. Or the admin, through the configuration. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our tutorial, we’re going to dispel a few of these myths. We
certainly make no claims as to Pacemaker being the one and only solution
for MySQL HA, but it’s one that serves lots of use cases excellently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I’ll also hang around for the conference proper, and
I’m very much looking forward to seeing lots of familiar faces. I’ll
also remain in the Bay Area for some time after the MySQL conference –
more on that in a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;
