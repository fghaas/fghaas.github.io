reasonably competent at is writing and publishing ads for open
positions, and I’ve received questions and requests for advice from
other folks who hire people. So I’m going to try and break down what I
consider a decent job ad. Not a perfect one mind you, perhaps not even
a particularly &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; one, just a decent one that people will want to
read, pass on, and maybe apply to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A few general notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to write an ad in such a way that it answers most of the
questions an applicant might have about the position. And I then
structure it like an imagined conversation between a potential
applicant (asking questions) and me, the hiring manager (answering
them). That’s why practically every subheading in the ad is a
question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my career ads, I give answers to this list of questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s this gig about? — The ultra-concise summary of the role to be
  filled. One sentence.&lt;sup id="fnref:one-sentence"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:one-sentence"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I be working on? — Details of the
  systems/processes/responsibilities associated with the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I know? — Prerequisite skills and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I learn? — Opportunities for acquiring new skills and
  knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What communities would I engage with? — People and communities
  &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; your organisation the employee would interact with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who would be my direct manager? — Information about yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How’s work at &lt;em&gt;company?&lt;/em&gt; — Notes on organisational culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does my team look like? — Notes on team composition and
  culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does my work week look like? — Information on how the team
  organises its work on a daily/weekly basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where can I work from? — Information about preferences or
  restrictions regarding the physical location of prospective
  employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I work from home?&lt;sup id="fnref:wfh"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wfh"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — Information about your remote work
  policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What timezone would I work in? — Most teams have preferred
  times-of-day when the majority of team members is awake and working,
  which tends to be when most work gets done. Or, else, your team may
  operate 24/7 in shifts, and you’re looking to cover a particular
  shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is travel involved? — Possibly a non-issue in the middle of a
  pandemic, but you might want to establish expectations for when it’s
  over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What employment conditions apply? — Have standard contractual
  clauses that apply to everyone, like vacation policies or specific
  packages? Might as well list them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When would I start? — Don’t assume that your applicants are
  available immediately. If people have a notice period in their
  current job to work with, they’ll want to know what’s the earliest
  and latest date you want the role filled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I make? — Compensation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I apply? — Details and deadlines related to the application
  process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few more details about several of these items, which I’ll try
to elaborate on as my time permits. So there should be more
installments in this series, eventually. Hopefully. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:one-sentence"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t condense the role description into one
sentence? You’ll either have to work on your editing skills, or
define the role better. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:one-sentence" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:wfh"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your answer to this question is “no”, I bid you good luck! &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:wfh" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
