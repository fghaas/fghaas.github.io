&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Contravictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
"elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contraviction is when a person firmly believes that two objectively
mutually exclusive standpoints are simultaneously true. Being
contravinced makes you extremely vulnerable to manipulation. Here’s
how to spot a contraviction, and what to do about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What format is this talk best suited for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk (~25-40 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audience Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the best target audience for this talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and
may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event. You should
make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as
possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events
to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your
talk is the one they should see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Contraviction" is a term I use for when a person is firmly convinced
of two sides of an obvious contradiction. This may sound like it would
be an unusual and rare occasion, and yet, once you start looking, they
are all over the place. A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of &lt;strong&gt;Nazi ideology&lt;/strong&gt; in Germany in the 1920s and 30s was
  the notion that Jews are engaged in a &lt;em&gt;successful&lt;/em&gt; global conspiracy
  to subjugate all nations including the German nation, and that Jews
  were also, &lt;em&gt;simultaneously,&lt;/em&gt; socially, intellectually, economically,
  and morally inferior to Germans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of &lt;strong&gt;religious extremism&lt;/strong&gt; is the belief that God is
  all-forgiving and merciful, and also that as long as a portion of
  humanity ("infidels") displeases God, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of humanity must suffer
  God's wrath. We see this in contemporary Islamic extremism, but
  Catholicism in the 16th century did no better in the conquest of
  Latin America, nor did Western Christianity do much differently
  during the medieval crusades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of &lt;strong&gt;Trumpism&lt;/strong&gt; is the notion that the United States of
  America is the greatest nation on Earth and that there is no better
  nation nor will there ever be, but also that America has been ruined
  by "the liberals" and has slipped into inferiority, so that it is
  necessary to "make America great again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all these examples, both statements can logically be false, or one
of them &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; theoretically be true — but if one is true, the other
one &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be false. And yet, people (&lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of people!) hold or
held both of these statements to be true, simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But being contravinced puts people in a very vulnerable position: if
someone gets you to believe both sides of a contradiction, they can
&lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; argue &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to follow from either one side, or the
opposite. Which means they can convince you of anything. And that
never ends well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk defines contravictions, highlights examples (even devopsy
ones!) and provides suggestions on how to uncover and dismantle
them. Because contravictions have the potential to poison and destroy
discourse, and that’s a cultural issue we all need to deal with —
among friends, family, and coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is
where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why
you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that the nature of this topic is sensitive and
emotional — yes I, an Austrian, will be talking about Nazi ideology,
in Israel, consider me terrified — I'll need to submit this on the
condition that I'd only want to deliver this talk &lt;em&gt;in person.&lt;/em&gt; If that
does not permit itself on account of the Covid-19 situation or of
travel restrictions, and I would have to rely on a streamed talk and
have no way of reading the room or scanning the audience for body
language feedback (some more details on this topic
&lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/08/24/online-conferences-audience-feedback/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),
then I'd rather not give the talk at all, rather than stream it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this disqualifies the talk (or if you just consider it too
controversial to begin with), no hard feelings at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag your talk to make it easier for event organizers to be able to
find. Examples are "ruby, javascript, rails".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Review Review: comparing code review, testing, staging and

&lt;h2&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
"elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub, GitLab, Gerrit — what should I choose? What’s the best review
process, the best CI/CD integration, the best deployment facility?
Which should I select for my startup, or consider migrating to? Which
supports good collaboration practices, which bad ones? This talk gives
the run-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What format is this talk best suited for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk (~25-40 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audience Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the best target audience for this talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and
may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event. You should
make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as
possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events
to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your
talk is the one they should see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DevOps, the process of collaborative review, testing, staging, and
deployment to production constitutes a core element of the work we
do. And we generally strive to make this process as effective,
efficient, smooth, and transparent as possible. Achieving that partly
comes from the work culture we shape and inhabit, partly from our
selection of tools — and of course, work culture and work tools
permanently and closely influence each other. This goes for both the
tools that drive review, and the tools that drive CI/CD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pull Request&lt;/strong&gt; process in combination with &lt;strong&gt;GitHub
  Actions&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;GitLab Merge Request&lt;/strong&gt; process in combination with &lt;strong&gt;GitLab
  CI&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;Gerrit Review&lt;/strong&gt; process in combination with &lt;strong&gt;Zuul&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these is perfect, all of them have their advantages and
disadvantages under particular circumstances. Some are meant to be
used principally as a service, some are fine to self-host. Some are
adamant about enforcing specific deployment practices, some follow a
more relaxed approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a summary of the current state of affairs with all these
tools, and contains recommendations on what to use under which
circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is
where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why
you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team and I have worked with all tools mentioned in a professional
capacity, and I believe I've got a very good understanding of the
relative merits of the systems presented. This does not include a
hard-and-fast recommendation for one particular tool or platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a talk that's suitable for both in-person and on-line events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag your talk to make it easier for event organizers to be able to
find. Examples are "ruby, javascript, rails".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Twitter, 2021-04-10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, &lt;a href="https://musings.danlj.org/about/"&gt;Michael K Johnson&lt;/a&gt; made
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mcdanlj/status/1380661700664422406"&gt;an interesting
point&lt;/a&gt; in
response to this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My way of thinking about DMs is a little different, or maybe we
 think differently about confidentiality. Work goes in public,
 meta-work is often about relationships, and I want my reports to be
 100% confident they can bring any question or concern to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So "encrypted email" is not the right metaphor or measuring stick in
my view. DMs are a tool for saying what you aren't comfortable
saying "out loud", but that shouldn't be about the work
itself. Never "how do I do this?" But "advice pls about how to work
with fred?" — yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entirely agree with the sentiments behind this; I still maintain
that chat DMs are not necessarily a good approach for addressing this,
for reason that some chat systems give merely an illusion of
confidentiality. If both participants in a conversation use OTR
encryption over a protocol like IRC or XMPP, inadvertent disclosure to
a third party is highly unlikely. Slack DMs? &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/slack-updates-privacy-policy-employers-can-read-private-dms-without-ncna862811"&gt;I wouldn't be so
sure&lt;/a&gt;. If
your report confides in you, you don't want them to have to worry if
their message is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; just between you and them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hacker News, 2021-09-25&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-09-25, &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28636536"&gt;a link to this
article&lt;/a&gt; ended up being
the top post on Hacker News for a few hours. You're very welcome to
read through the 200-odd comments in that thread, but here I'd like to
respond to just a couple. I'm deliberately only picking out ones where I
feel like &lt;em&gt;clarification&lt;/em&gt; on my part is necessary; as far as
differences of opinion are concerned I'll be happy to let those stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also assumes every one is a native speaker who can write
quickly and clearly in a chat -- in a lot of international projects
this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28651678"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;code&gt;papaf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My native language is German, and neither at the time of presenting
the original talk nor at the time of writing this update did I work
with anyone who is a first-language English speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an objection to the author's blanket disregard for "pings" in
chat - while the request could/should be worded a bit more clearly
than just "ping", IMHO they're a valid way of requesting if an
opportunity for synchronous communication is available in the (not
that rare!) cases where asynchronous communication would be
worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blanket disregard is for &lt;em&gt;naked&lt;/em&gt; pings, not for pings in general.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="presentations"></category><category term="Conference"></category><category term="Communications"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry><entry><title>Audience feedback on online conference platforms: a speaker's view</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/08/24/online-conferences-audience-feedback/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2021-08-24:/blog/2021/08/24/online-conferences-audience-feedback/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a speaker, I look for something very specific in online conference platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are in year 2 of the Covid-19 pandemic, and open-source conferences
are still, for the most part, online-only events. (And I find myself
questioning the judgment of those that put on large in-person
conferences.) I have spoken at several of such conferences, and I'd
like to zero in on one aspect of my &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; experience, &lt;em&gt;as a
speaker,&lt;/em&gt; on some of the conference platforms I worked with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I should explain one thing up front. As a speaker, the thing I
care the most about is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is this talk useful to you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the paramount question. I want you to take something
away from the talk &lt;em&gt;that you find useful.&lt;/em&gt; Whether that's a technical
insight, or a new angle on a problem, or even just entertainment, I
want there to be something in the talk &lt;em&gt;for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's incredibly important for me to get a sense of that, as I am
delivering the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in an in-person event, that's easy: all I need is a look across
the room, and I &lt;em&gt;permanently&lt;/em&gt; look across the room. I can tell if
you're making eye contact, or listening intently, or nodding your
head, or even putting on a face that makes it clear that you're
violently disagreeing with me. Sure, if you raise your hand and ask a
question, or heckle me, or laugh at a joke, that drives the point of
your engagement home — but I don't need you to become so &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt;
engaged, to know &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you are engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is &lt;em&gt;this kind of feedback&lt;/em&gt; (that you might not even realize
you're giving me!) that makes the difference between delivering a
talk, and just speaking into the void. It's also the difference
between delivering a conference talk, even if it's a pre-recorded one,
and just uploading the video on YouTube. If an conference platform
doesn't give me that kind of feedback channel, the work that I put
into writing, rehearsing, and recording/streaming the talk is better
spent with a view toward upload to a video hosting platform, and
engaging with viewers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I as a speaker am foremost interested in a single thing about the
conference platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is it easy for you to tell me if my talk is useful to you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm not talking about you getting into a chat and saying "this is
useful." That's much too high of a threshold. How often do you sit in
a talk and then &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; the speaker, "hey, that's useful"? Quite
rarely, and only if you find the content &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; actionable or
insightful. Because you normally don't &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; tell me explicitly:
if you're actively listening to me, I can tell. And I know you
wouldn't be listening to me if I talked useless nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is one of the reasons why I like
&lt;a href="https://venueless.org/en/"&gt;Venueless&lt;/a&gt; so much. Venueless has
implemented an extremely low-threshold feature of showing audience
engagement. You get a handful of emoji like ❤️👏🤣👍🤔 that you, as a
viewer, can click on, and then they appear in the event chat stream
like "emoji rain" from the top of the screen. Just one click, which
also gets anonymized and lost in the crowd — this last bit is
important for people who are shy or reserved, and don't like to stick
their head out. And this makes it so much easier for you to engage,
than having to actually type a sentence (or even a word, or even
&lt;em&gt;typing&lt;/em&gt; an emoji) into a chat channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can not tell you enough how much of a difference this makes to the
speaker experience.&lt;/em&gt; Add to this that the event chat is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; shackled
to Slack or any other horribly overgrown not-even-really-chat platform
anymore, and you've got a simple, easy-to-use, no-unnecessary-frills
experience that puts you &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; in touch with your audience. I
loved this at &lt;a href="https://2020.pycon.org.au/"&gt;PyCon AU&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, I also saw &lt;a href="https://loudswarm.com/"&gt;LoudSwarm&lt;/a&gt; at
&lt;a href="https://2021.djangocon.eu/"&gt;DjangoCon Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The way it was used in
that conference it seemed very tightly tied to Slack, although the
audience was very nice in using emoji reactions very
generously. Still, it wasn't the same quality of feedback that
Venueless provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/lukas2511/voctoconf"&gt;Voctoconf&lt;/a&gt;, which I saw at
FrOSCon, allegedly predates Venueless and was excellent in terms of
streaming, but in terms of audience interaction it's essentially
&lt;a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/"&gt;BigBlueButton&lt;/a&gt; on steroids, meaning it's
about on the same level as the LoudSwarm/Slack combination I saw at
DjangoCon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="Conference"></category></entry><entry><title>Add Depth!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereoscopic imagery (photography and videography) is a fascinating
way to create 3-dimensional images of landscapes, unmoving and moving
objects, and of course, people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll cover the basics of stereoscopic imagery and
projection, discover how stereoscopic vision works, and how we can
trick our brains into perceiving depth from two flat images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with the principles of three-dimensional vision in humans:
how our eyes use the combination of focus and vergence to signal two
slightly different images of our surroundings to our brain, and how
our brain then processes these images to give us the perception of
depth. Then, we discuss the techniques available to play tricks on our
brains in which two slightly (but cleverly) distinct &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;-dimensional
images are presented to our eyes in such a way that our mind conjures
up depth where there objectively is none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques come in various forms, from very high tech (such as
virtual reality goggles) to very low tech (like mechanical
stereoscopic viewers), but some can deal without any projection
technology at all: this is called freeviewing, and for most people it
is a remarkably simple and low-cost way to enjoy stunning
three-dimensional imagery. We'll cover the parallel-view and crossview
freeviewing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll then dive into the simple but highly effective steps of making
stereoscopic images, using run-of-the-mill cameras (even cell phones),
and some straightforward image processing in the GIMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we talk about some neat little tricks to make stereoscopic
videos, with minimal cost and investment. We'll look at how we can
make 3D video with just a GoPro, or a simple drone camera — again
using a free software tool, namely the OpenShot video editor, for
processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will only be shown to organisers and reviewers. You should
provide any details about your proposal that you don't want to be
public here. This field is rendered with the monospace font Hack

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk does not cover a specific software project; the "Project
URL" below is simply a Flickr album containing a set of stereoscopic
images created with the technique I am describing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that LCA is an online event this year would suit this talk
particularly well: when I get to the point of explaining freeviewing
to attendees, I would expect novices to have some difficulty with
&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the freeviewing techniques, and some, with both. The latter
would have the option of simply backing up the stream and re-watching
the instructions and the test images provided, which is an option that
would not exist in a live talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility note: Regretfully, this talk will have limited
accessibility for people with vision deficiencies. Specifically, the
3D effects presented will be inaccessible to people with complete loss
of vision in one eye (or both), nystagmus, or strabismus. People with
these conditions will still be able to learn from the techniques
presented in the talk, but will likely be unable to perceive the
demonstrated 3D effects themselves. People with intraocular lens (IOL)
implants might also have difficulty following some of the examples in
the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome, dear FrOScon people — this is my talk on
communications in distributed teams. My name is Florian, this is the
second time I‘m speaking at FrOScon, and you probably want to know
what the hell qualifies me to talk about this specific issue. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why am I talking here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why am I talking about &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or rather more precisely, why am &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; talking about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned 40 last year, have been in IT for about 20 years now (19
full-time), and out of that I have worked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in 4 successive companies, all of which worked out of offices,
  for 11 years, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a completely distributed company, that I founded, for 6 years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and now, for about three years, I have been running a distributed
  team that is a business unit of a company that has existed for 15
  years and throughout that time, has only ever worked from a single
  office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think I might have seen and become aware of some of the rather
interesting challenges that come with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What changed since last time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally wrote and presented this talk for the first time in
December 2019. At the time, you probably had forgotten about SARS, had
no idea what SARS-CoV2 or COVID-19 were, and many of you were probably
working from offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then something like three months later, everything changed and
suddenly, this talk became much more relevant to a much greater
audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And something else happened: a lot of people suddenly started talking
about working from home and distributed teams, and a lot of those
people who were talking very loudly, had themselves only been working
with or managing distributed teams since March. And a fair amount of
what you could about the subject then, and can still read now, is
complete and utter bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s one point I actually &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; make in the initial version
of this talk, because I thought it was self-evident. But I have come
to the conclusion that to a lot of people it is not, so to rectify
this omission from last December — and with apologies for that
omission to the wonderful DevOpsDays Tel Aviv crowd, who were my first
audience for this talk, let me make this one thing very clear from the
outset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective distributed collaboration is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; pretending to be in
an office while staring into a webcam all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will never be able to capitalize on work as a distributed team
unless you kick some office habits. The key to distributed teams being
effective is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; that they happen to not be in the same place, as
you’ll see from the remainder of this talk. So to expect success from
the approach that you take the habits of an office, simply remove the
element of locality, replace every face to face meeting with a video
call and carry on, is ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that if you do it right, you’ll end up with a far
better team than a local one would ever be, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; everyone has a
chance at far better work-life balance, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you don’t waste awful
amounts of time and energy and fossil fuels on your commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in this talk?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’ll find a few general themes throughout this talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What modes we have &lt;em&gt;available&lt;/em&gt; for communications in teams;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why distributed teams always collaborate &lt;em&gt;asynchronously,&lt;/em&gt; and what
  communication modes lend themselves to that particularly well;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;written communication&lt;/em&gt; is so important in distributed teams;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why &lt;em&gt;meetings&lt;/em&gt; (like video calls) are a mode of communication
  that effective distributed teams hardly ever need to use — except
  for very specific reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do want to state one thing upfront:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing of what I am talking about is steeped in any scientific
rigour. I present anecdotes, not evidence. I might be mistaking
correlation for causation, or the other way round. It’s solely based
on my personal experience, and the experience of others I have talked
to, watched, or read. Everything I say here is subject to debate and
rebuttal, or you can simply have a different opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s definitely &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with all of that said, let me attempt to give a definition of a
distributed team, according to my understanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed team is a &lt;strong&gt;professional&lt;/strong&gt; group whose members do not
rely on proximity in order to &lt;strong&gt;routinely&lt;/strong&gt; collaborate
productively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is clearly not an ideal definition, not least because it
defines something by a negative, and an outside factor to boot: it
defines a distributed team by what it &lt;em&gt;does not need&lt;/em&gt; to exist to
function. But it’s the best definition I’ve been able to come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s a couple of key words in here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m talking about teams that work towards a
  professional goal. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they all work
  in the same company. They could, for example, all work in different
  companies collaborating on a joint project, which is what frequently
  happens in open source software projects. But they’re not pursuing
  their hobby, they’re doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routinely.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m talking about teams that &lt;em&gt;habitually&lt;/em&gt; work in a
  distributed fashion, not the work that goes on in an office-based
  team when one person is having a work-from-home day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that that lack of proximity is not only
spatial, it is temporal as well, because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in a distributed team means &lt;strong&gt;working asynchronously.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your team is distributed, this is equivalent to saying that it
works in an asynchronous fashion, that is to say, that people will
work on things in parallel, and a capable distributed team will have
just as few synchronization points as absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is not just working in different timezones, but
also the fact that everyone will have their own daily routine, and/or
have their individual times when they are most productive. Which you
&lt;em&gt;will not attempt to synchronize.&lt;/em&gt; (Doing so would mean setting the
entire team up for failure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn’t come for free, nor does it fall in our lap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being productive in a distributed team is a skill
that most people must &lt;strong&gt;learn;&lt;/strong&gt; it is not innate to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are not born with the ability to work in a distributed
team. Humans function best in groups that collaborate in close
proximity to one another; it is only very recently that technology has
started to enable us to override that to an extent — giving us other
benefits like the ability to work from home, or the ability to hire
people residing anywhere, provided they have internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we now &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; work in teams despite being continental distances away
from each other but we do have to acquire the skills to do that. And
if we fail to do so, that has a rather grave disadvantage, which is
that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing&lt;/strong&gt; has as dire an impact on productivity as &lt;strong&gt;poor
communications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a truism that applies to both distributed and non-distributed
teams. Having bad communications will wreck any project, blow any
budget, fail any objective. Now note that the reverse is &lt;em&gt;not true:&lt;/em&gt;
having &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; communications does not guarantee success. But having
bad communications does guarantee failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is one thing to start with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A capable distributed team &lt;strong&gt;habitually externalises&lt;/strong&gt; information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information is generally far less useful when it is only stored in one
person’s head, as opposed to being accessible in a shared system that
everyone trusts and can use. If you take important information out of
your own head and store it in a medium that allows others to easily
find and contextualise it, that’s a win for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since we’re all technology people, we typically have multiple
facilities to externalise, share, and then access information at our
disposal. So let’s see how those compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modes of communication in distributed teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed team will habitually use multiple modes of
communication, relying mostly on those that make sharing, finding, and
contextualising information easy, and avoiding those that make it
difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many teams, distributed or not, using chat as a default mode of
communication is becoming the norm. Now with an important exception,
which I’ll get to near the end of the talk, this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a symptom
of having a particularly dynamic or efficient team; it’s the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessively using chat isn’t being efficient.
It’s being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a symptom of the worst kind of laziness &lt;em&gt;(not malice!)&lt;/em&gt;: in an
attempt to communicate quickly and easily, for yourself, you are really
making things harder for everyone, including yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;Share&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;Find&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Contextualise&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Chat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙁&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because, while &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; information in a chat is extremely
easy, it is also a “fire and forget” mode of communications. Chat
makes it difficult to find information after the fact. If you’ve ever
attempted to scour a busy Slack or IRC archive for a discussion on a
specific topic that you only remember to have happened a “few months
ago”, you’ll agree with me here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; difficult to read a Slack discussion in context, that
is to say in relation to &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; discussions on the same topic, days
or weeks earlier or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s compare that to other communication modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;Share&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;Find&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Contextualise&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Chat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙁&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email makes it easy to share information with a person or a group
  from the get-go, but quite difficult to loop people into an ongoing
  discussion after the fact. Finding information later is just as hard
  as with chat, and it’s marginally better at contextualizing
  information than chat (because you get proper threading).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;Share&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;Find&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Contextualise&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Chat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙁&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wiki&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Issue tracker&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A wiki and an issue tracker (provided you don’t lock them down with
  silly view permissions), in contrast, both make it &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy to
  share, find, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; contextualise information.&lt;br/&gt;
  Note that “wiki”, in this context, is shorthand for any facility
  that allows you to collaboratively edit long-form documents
  online. That can be an actual wiki like a MediaWiki, but also
  something like Confluence, or even shared Google Docs.&lt;br/&gt;
  Likewise, “issue tracker” can mean RT, OTRS, Jira, Taiga, Bugzilla,
  whatever works for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;Share&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;Find&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Contextualise&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Chat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙁&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wiki&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Issue tracker&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙂&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Video call&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;😐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;🙁&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;🙁&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video calls are even worse than chat or email, because sharing
  information works but doesn’t scale — you can’t reasonably have more
  than 5-or-so people in a video call, and sharing the recording of a
  full video call is just pointless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, make your wiki and your issue tracker your default mode of
communications, and use the others sparingly. (This isn’t meant to be
a euphemism for “don’t use them”, as we’ll get to in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Text chat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Let’s talk about text chat. These days, that frequently means
&lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, but what I am talking about also and
equally applies to
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://mattermost.com/"&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://riot.im/"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;, and 
anything similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is text chat universally useful? No. Is it universally bad? Not that,
either. There is a very specific type of situation in which text chat
is a good thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;chat&lt;/strong&gt; for collaboration that requires &lt;strong&gt;immediate,
interactive mutual feedback.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using interactive chat is a good idea for the kind of communication
that requires immediate, interactive mutual feedback from two or more
participants. If that is not the case, chat is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the only thing that chat is good for is communication
that is required to be &lt;em&gt;synchronous,&lt;/em&gt; and remember, in a distributed
team &lt;em&gt;asychronicity&lt;/em&gt; is the norm. So using interactive chat for
communications needs to be an &lt;em&gt;exceptional&lt;/em&gt; event for a distributed
team; if it is instead a regular occurrence you’ll make everyone on
the team miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any interaction that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require feedback that is &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;
immediate and interactive, email, a wiki, or an issue tracker are &lt;em&gt;far
superior&lt;/em&gt; modes of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason to use &lt;strong&gt;DMs&lt;/strong&gt; for collaboration&lt;br/&gt;
is a need for immediate, interactive mutual feedback&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and confidentiality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using chat direct messages (DMs) as the &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; means of
communication is utterly braindead. In order for a chat DM to be
useful, there is precisely one clearly delineated confluence of events
that must occur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need immediate feedback from the other person,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need mutual back-and-forth with the other person,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don’t want others to follow the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t emphasize enough that this combination is perfectly valid —
but it is &lt;em&gt;exceedingly rare.&lt;/em&gt; If you want just a private exchange of
ideas with someone, encrypted email will do. If you want to work on
something together with one person before you share it with others,
restricted view permissions on a wiki page or an issue tracker ticket
will work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t need confidentiality but you do need interactive and
immediate feedback, chances are that you’re working on something
urgent, and it is far more likely you’ll eventually need to poll other
opinions, than that you won’t. So just use a shared channel from the
get-go, that way it’s easier for others to follow the conversation if
needed — and they might be able to point out an incorrect assumption
that one of you has, before you end up chasing a red herring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chat ping is a shoulder tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pinging” someone in a chat (that is, mentioning their username, which
usually triggers a visual or auditory notification), is exactly like
walking up to a person, interrupting what they are doing, tapping them
on the shoulder, and asking them a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter whether it is your intention or not,&lt;/strong&gt; they will feel
compelled to answer, relatively promptly (the only exception is when
you’ve done this so often that you have conditioned your colleagues
to ignore you — congratulations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you’ve broken their train of thought, yanked them out
of a potentially complex task, forced them to redo what they did
pre-interruption, or actually have them commit a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pinging someone in a chat is something you should only do if you
are aware of exactly this risk, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you are convinced that whatever
you’re pinging about is more important. Otherwise, to be very blunt,
you’ll be seen as the asshole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want people to hate you? Send naked pings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “naked ping” is the action of sending someone a message consisting
only of their username and a marker like “ping”, “hi”, “hey” or
similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;johndoe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;florian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;florian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;johndoe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t. Just don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any person who is versed in the use of chat communications will, when
subjected to this behavior, be inclined to flay you alive. Infinitely
more so if it’s a DM. &lt;strong&gt;Do not do this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, always provide context. Always always always. Don’t say “can
I ask you a question, instead, &lt;em&gt;ask the question.&lt;/em&gt; If something isn’t
urgent, say something like “no urgency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;johndoe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;florian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1422&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;florian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;johndoe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;afk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kiddo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;johndoe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;florian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be self-evident why this is better than naked pings, but if
to you it is not, then please read &lt;a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/markmc/2014/02/20/naked-pings/"&gt;Naked
Pings&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;h2&gt;Video calls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Zoom, Hangouts, BlueJeans etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I’d like to talk about video calls. Doesn’t matter what
technology you’re using. Could be Zoom, Google Hangouts, BlueJeans,
Jitsi, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’d like to address this specifically, given the fact that in the
current pandemic the use of video calls appears to have skyrocketed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a very good reason to use video calls: they give you the
ability to pick up on nontextual and nonverbal cues from the call
participants. But that’s really the only good reason to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video calls have a significant drawback: until we get reliable
automatic speech recognition and transcription, they are only
half-on-the-record. Hardly anyone goes to the trouble of preparing a
full transcript of a meeting, and if anything, we get perhaps a
summary of points discussed and action items agreed to. So even if we
keep recordings of every video call we attend, it’s practically
impossible to discern, after the fact, what was discussed in a meeting
&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; decisions were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also practically impossible to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; a discussion point that
you only have a vague recollection of when it was discussed in a video
call, whereas doing so has a much greater probability of success if
a discussion took place on any archived text-based medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every video call needs an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, true for any meeting, not just those conducted by
video call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conversation without an agenda is useless. You want people to know
what to expect of the call. You also want to give people the option to
prepare for the call, such as doing some research or pulling together
some documentation. If you fail to circulate those &lt;em&gt;ahead of time,&lt;/em&gt; I
can guarantee that the call will be ineffective, and will likely
result in a repeat performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until machines get intelligent enough to automatically transcribe
and summarise words spoken in a meeting, &lt;strong&gt;write notes and a summary
of every meeting you attend,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;circulate them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as important as an agenda to set the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of the meeting, is
a set of notes that describes its &lt;em&gt;outcome&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective distributed teams understand that the &lt;em&gt;record&lt;/em&gt; of a call is
what counts, not the call itself. It is not the spoken word that
matters, but the written one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that follows this consequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be useful, the write-up of a call &lt;strong&gt;takes more time and effort&lt;/strong&gt;
than the call itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that video calls are any less work than chat meetings or
a shared document that’s being edited together or dicussed in
comments, think again. The only way a video call is less work, is when
everyone’s lazy and the call is, therefore, useless. Every meeting
needs notes and a summary, and you need to circulate these notes not
only with everyone who attended the meeting, but with everyone who has
a need-to-know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the standard outline I use for meeting notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date, time, attendees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion points (tabular)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting an executive summary at the very top is extraordinarily
helpful so people can decide if they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should familiarise themselves with what was discussed, immediately,
  and possibly respond if they have objections, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only want to be aware of what was decided, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just keep in the back of their head that a meeting happened, that
  notes exist, and where they can find them when they need to refer
  back to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you do meetings right, you no longer need most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that once you adhere to this standard — and I
repeat, having a full and detailed record is &lt;em&gt;the only acceptable
standard&lt;/em&gt; for video meetings – you’ll note that you can actually skip
the meeting altogether, use &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a collaboratively edited document
&lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of your meeting notes, and remove your unnecessary
synchronization point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Video calls for recurring team meetings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one thing that I do believe video calls are good for, and
that is to use them for &lt;em&gt;recurring&lt;/em&gt; meetings as as an
opportunity to feel the pulse of your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a distributed team has &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; recurring meetings, because
they are synchronization points, and we’ve already discussed that we
strive to minimize those. So the idea of having daily standups, sprint
planning meetings, and sprint retrospectives is fundamentally
incompatible with distributed teams. &lt;em&gt;Aside: in my humble opinion,
this is also why using Scrum is a terrible idea in distributed teams —
not to mention &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/f-ULT_Ic4qk"&gt;that it’s a terrible idea,
period.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having perhaps one meeting per week (or maybe even one every
two weeks) in a video call is useful &lt;em&gt;precisely for the aforementioned
reasons&lt;/em&gt; of being able to pick up on nonverbal clues like body
language, posture, facial expressions, and tone. If people are
stressed out or unhappy, it’ll show. If they are relaxed and
productive, that will show too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that these meetings, which of course do follow the same rules
about agenda and notes, are not strictly &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to get the work
done. The team I run has one one-hour meeting a week, but whenever
that meeting conflicts with anything we skip it and divide up our
work via just the circulated coordination notes, and that works
too. The meeting really serves the purpose of syncing emotionally, and
picking up on nonverbal communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Briefing people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you need to thoroughly &lt;strong&gt;brief a group of people on an
important matter,&lt;/strong&gt; consider using a &lt;strong&gt;5-paragraph format.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command and Signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a format as it is being used by many armed forces; in NATO
parlance it’s called the 5-paragraph field order. Now I’m generally
not a fan of applying military thinking to civilian life — after all
we shouldn’t forget that the military is an institution that kills
people and breaks things, and I say that as a commissioned officer in
my own country’s army —, but in this case it’s actually something that
can very much be applied to professional communications, with some
rather minor modifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break these down in a little detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation is about what position we’re in, and &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; we set out
   to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three
   sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your
   own company, any extra help that is available, and the current
   market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective is &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; we want to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan is &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; we want to achieve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logistics is about what budget and resources are available, and how
   they are used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communications is about how you’ll be coordinating among yourselves
   and with others in order to achieve your goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that people &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have questions on what they’ve just been
briefed about. They just might not think of them straight away. Give
people time to think through what you’ve just briefed them on, and
they will think of good questions. So always have a follow-up round at
a later time (2 hours later, the following day, whatever), for which
you &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt; your group to come back with questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, use that same follow-up for checking how your briefing came
across, by gently quizzing people with questions like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“by what date do we want to implement X?”, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Joe, what things will you need to coordinate with Jane on?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives you valuable feedback on the quality of your briefing: if
your team can’t answer these questions, chances are that you weren’t
as clear as you should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pinching the firehose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to say a few words about what I like to call pinching
the figurative firehose you might otherwise be forced to drink from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of incoming information in a distributed team can be
daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work in a distributed team, since everyone is on their own
schedule and everything is asynchronous, you may be dealing with a
constant incoming stream of information — from your colleagues, your
reports, your manager, your customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to change this, so what you need to do is apply your
own structure to that stream. What follows is not &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; way to do
that, but &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way, and you may find another works better for
you. But you will need to define and apply &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; structure, otherwise
you’ll feel constantly overwhelmed and run the risk of burning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider using the &lt;strong&gt;“4-D” approach&lt;/strong&gt; when dealing with incoming
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hat tip to David Allen)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a defined approach for doing this, which I learned about from
reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)"&gt;David
Allen&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done"&gt;Getting
Things
Done&lt;/a&gt;. I
don’t know if Allen invented the 4-D approach or whether someone came
up with it before him, but that’s how I know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, David Allen suggests to apply one of the following four
actions to any incoming bit of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drop&lt;/strong&gt; means read, understand, and then archive. It’s what you use
  for anything that doesn’t require any action on your part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegate&lt;/strong&gt; is for things that do require action, but not from
  you. Make sure that it gets to the right person and is understood by
  &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, and make a note for follow-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defer&lt;/strong&gt; means it needs doing, and it’s you who needs to do it, but
  it doesn’t need doing &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;. Enter it into your task list
  (to use a very generic term, more on this in a bit), and clear it
  from your inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do&lt;/strong&gt; are the (typically very few) things that remain that need to
  be done &lt;em&gt;by you, and immediately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this approach does not mean that you’ll never be overwhelmed
by the amount of information that you need to process. But it’ll
greatly reduce that risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Drop” rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dropping” things doesn’t mean ignoring them. You still have to read
and understand what’s in them, and be able to find them later. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never delete things (except spam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only archive them in a way that that keeps them retrievable in the
  future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there something isn’t understandable to you, think it through and
  look for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Delegate” rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegation obviously requires that there is a person you can delegate
to. This is &lt;em&gt;not necessarily&lt;/em&gt; someone who reports to you; indeed, it
might be someone &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; report to. (You might be asked to deal with
something that you have no control over, but your manager does.) So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the right person that can get the task done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preemptively send them &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the information that you think they
  might need (and that you have access to), rather than relying on
  them to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask them to acknowledge that they have received what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a note to follow up to see if they need anything else, and
  follow through by seeing the task to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within your own team, &lt;strong&gt;you only ever delegate tasks, not
responsibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasks without follow-up and follow-through are a waste of people’s
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not delegate, or even define, tasks that you are not prepared to
follow through on. If you handwave “everyone use encrypted email from
now on,” and you’re not even prepared to make that work for your own
email account, you might as well just leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you do proclaim an objective or rule and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you find yourself
unable to see it through — &lt;em&gt;this happens,&lt;/em&gt; and is no sign of
ineptitude or failure — then loudly and clearly rescind it. It’s far
better for you to visibly backtrack, than to be perceived as someone
whose pronouncements are safe to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Defer” rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deferring simply means that because something you need to do doesn’t
need doing &lt;em&gt;immediately,&lt;/em&gt; you can do it at a time that suits your
schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you’ll need to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;add the task immediately to some sort of queue (for email, this can
  be a folder named “Needs Reply”),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make sure to go through that queue at a later time to prioritize
  (ideally, right after you’re done with your “Do” tasks, which we’ll
  get to in a second),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;absolutely ensure that you make time to go back and actually do your
  prioritized tasks, at a time you consider convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Do” rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, there’ll be your “Do” tasks — stuff that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need to
do, and do immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell people that you’re doing them, because you’ll want to be
  uninterrupted. Update your chat status, put some blocked time in
  your calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’ll be uninterrupted. For email, turn off all your
  notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plow through all the undropped, undelegated,
  undeferred items in your inbox until it’s empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But what about the watercooler?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entirety of this talk, up to this point, has focused on
professional communications. And among people unfamiliar or
unexperienced with work in a distributed team, it is often accepted
that teams can communicate well “professionally.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they frequently ask, “what about watercooler chats? What about
the many informal discussions that happen at work while people are
getting some water or coffee, or sit together over lunch? There’s
always so much communication happening at work that’s informal, but is
extremely beneficial to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office workers often don’t habitually externalise information. A
distributed team that tries that won’t last a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, many companies where information exchange hinges on coffee or
cafeteria talk simply don’t give a damn about externalising
information. Sure, if 90% of your company’s knowledge is only in
people’s heads, you’re dead without the lunchroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the same thing happens in a distributed team, it never gets off
the ground. So, if you have a team that’s functional and productive,
&lt;em&gt;because it habitually externalises information,&lt;/em&gt; the absence of
chit-chat over coffee has zero negative impact on information flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you may also be interested in the completely non-work-related
talk that happens over coffee, that simply contributes to people’s
relaxation and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People working in distributed teams are often introverts. Or they
simply choose to have their social relationships outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this might shock some people, but there are plenty of people
who can make a terrific contribution to your company, but who dislike
the “social” aspect of work. They might thrive when being left
alone, with as little small-talk as possible, and ample opportunity to
socialize with their friends and family, away from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you do have people on your team that enjoy having an entirely
informal conversation every once in a while, there totally is room for
that even in a distributed team. All you need to do is agree on a
signal that means “I’m taking a break and I’d be happy to chat with
anyone who’s inclined, preferably about non work related things” (or
whatever meaning your group agrees on). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a keyword on IRC,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a message to a specific channel, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(if you want to get fancy) a bot that updates your group calendar
  when it receives a message with a particular format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as a word of caution, I’ve actually done this with my team
before, and it didn’t catch on — for the simple reason that we almost
never took breaks that happened to overlap. But that doesn’t rule out
that it works on &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; team, and also there’s always the remote
possibility that two or more people on your team might like to
schedule their breaks concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; do, of course, is have a channel in which you can
discuss completely random things that are not work related. And if the
rule is that confidential or company-proprietary discussion topics are
off-limits there, the channel might as well be public. It might even
be Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The antithesis: ChatOps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to mention one other thing for balance. There is a complete
alternative framework for distributed teams working together, and it’s
what people refer to as ChatOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the best of my knowledge, the first company to run ChatOps on a
large scale &lt;em&gt;and talk about it publicly&lt;/em&gt; was GitHub, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NST3u-GjjFw"&gt;back in
2013&lt;/a&gt; in a
&lt;a href="https://www.rubyfuza.org/"&gt;RubyFuza&lt;/a&gt; talk by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jnewland"&gt;Jesse
Newland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a distributed team operates on a ChatOps basis, the interactive
text chat is where absolutely everything happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone lives in chat all the time, and all issues, alerts and events are
  piped into the chat.&lt;br/&gt;
  Everything is discussed in the chat, and everything is also
  &lt;em&gt;resolved&lt;/em&gt; in the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a system relies on heavy use of chat bots. For example, if an
  alert lands in the channel, and the discussion then yields that the
  proper fix to the problem is to run a specific Ansible playbook,
  you send an in-chat bot command that kicks off that playbook, and
  then reports its result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is of course very laudable, because it resolves a major issue
with using chat, which is the classic scenario of something being
discussed in a chat, someone else then going away for a bit and then
coming back saying “I fixed it!”, and nobody else actually
understanding what the problem was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make everything explicit and in-band, in becomes easy, in
principle, to go back to a previously-solved problem that reappears,
and replay the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When does ChatOps make sense? Here’s a hint: It’s called Chat&lt;strong&gt;Ops&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can this make sense? Yes, absolutely. Under what circumstances
though? I maintain that this is best suited for when your work tends
to be inherently linear with respect to some dimension. For example,
if your primary job is to keep a system operational versus the linear
passage of &lt;em&gt;time,&lt;/em&gt; ChatOps is an excellent approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And keeping complex systems operational over time is the definition
of, you guessed it, ops. So ChatOps may be a very suitable
communication mode for operations, but it’s highly unlikely to be
efficient as a generic mode of communication across distributed teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even then I posit it’s difficult to get right, since you’ll have
to curb channel sprawl and threading and other things, but’s that’s a
whole ‘nother talk and indeed a talk for another &lt;em&gt;speaker,&lt;/em&gt; because I
don’t lead an ops team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To summarize...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, here are my key points from this talk, in a nutshell
— please make these your key takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed teams are better than localized teams — not because
  they’re distributed, but because they’re asynchronous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid anything that makes a distributed team run synchronously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use less chat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fewer meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write. Things. Down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

two of my submitted talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No really, don’t chuck everything in Slack: Communications for distributed teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 40-minute talk that I presented after keynotes on day 2. It
deals with the specific challenges that distributed teams face and
solve, and has a bunch of ready-to-go suggestions to communicate
better as a distributed team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two surprises in this talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of people still appear to be unfamiliar with the
   term &lt;a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/markmc/2014/02/20/naked-pings/"&gt;naked ping&lt;/a&gt;,
   even though just about everyone is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; familiar with the
   antipattern itself. It resulted in an “oh so &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; what that’s
   called!” reaction from a significant share of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually try to not throw shade in my talks. But if and when I do
   it’s usually about Scrum, which I continue to consider a patently
   ludicrous idea. I did mention Scrum in a negative manner in my
   talk, and got a rather unexpected round of mid-talk applause. (My
   talks generally tend to be rather matter-of-factly; mid-sentence
   applause is not something I’m used to.) Speaking to a crowd that
   skewed hard toward the software engineering profession, this always
   gets me thinking: engineers understand that Scrum is horrible; when
   will their managers catch on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video for this talk is forthcoming, but for now you can find my
slides (with full speaker notes) on

&lt;h2&gt;Five is Fine: A case for small teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a 5-minute talk delivered as part of a round of “Ignite”
talks. I use scare quotes because DevOpsDaysTLV uses a somewhat
relaxed Ignite format: you must deliver your talk in 5 minutes, but
you’re not restricted to the exact number of 20 slides, and your
slides also don’t auto-advance every 15 seconds. I did not know this,
so I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; follow the original Ignite format, using reveal.js
autoSlide to advance my slides every 15000 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These talks were also recorded, and the recording should become
available relatively shortly (I will update this post when they
do). As with the other talk, the slides are available on 
&lt;a href="https://fghaas.github.io/five-is-fine/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and include my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wholemilk"&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt; for
suggesting that I write this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know a conference that might like these talks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you organize a conference that might be interested in including
these talks, or you’ve attended one that you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; might, please
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi"&gt;find me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and let me
know. I’ll be happy to submit one of them for consideration. I could
definitely expand the Ignite talk into a full standard-length talk —
doing the reverse for the other one might be a bit challenging,
though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="presentations"></category><category term="Conference"></category></entry><entry><title>Slidecraft updates</title><link href="https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2019/12/13/slidecraft/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Haas</name></author><id>tag:xahteiwi.eu,2019-12-13:/blog/2019/12/13/slidecraft/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing public talks and presentations rather frequently for the last 10-or-so years, but this year I made significant changes to my process for creating, rehearsing, and presenting talks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing public talks and presentations rather frequently for
the last 10-or-so years, but this year I made significant changes to
my process for creating, rehearsing, and presenting talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I used to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started doing talks a while back, I followed an approach that
many of us were at some point either taught, or adopted by emulating
our peers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would roughly sketch an outline,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I’d create slides (usually on a company or conference template),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I’d add some speaker notes in bullet-point fashion,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I’d rehearse the talk,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and finally I’d refine my content based on whether I was short or
  long in terms of the available time slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a very conventional approach, and it tends to focus very much
on getting the slides right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I do things differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I do now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to the conclusion that what I really want my audience to
focus on is what I am &lt;em&gt;talking&lt;/em&gt; about. So now, I do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still start with a rough — &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rough — outline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next though, I write my speaker notes. All of them. Yes, that means
  I write out my &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; talk, and this may well take days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I do a first practice run. Is there a good natural flow? Will
  it make sense to someone completely unfamiliar with my topic? Is the
  story I’m telling logical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I edit. This process of alternating rehearsal and edits
  continues until I’m reasonably happy with the whole talk, and I have
  timed it and am happy with my pacing, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then do I start creating my slides, and I usually completely
  disregard conference templates, for reasons I’ll get to in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that means that when I ultimately deliver the talk, I’m actually
reading from my notes. Except when I’m just riffing and ad-libbing
over them. Chances are, unless you know me very well, you’ll be unable
to tell. That’s because I write my notes like I talk, and I pay more
attention to flow and stress and rhythm than I do to grammar and
exactitude. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ruehcRDRIgM"&gt;This talk&lt;/a&gt;, just like
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ZifNGprBUTA"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cRqA-eYYOXE"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; were all delivered from fully
written speaker notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully writing out my talk has also enabled me to greatly reduce my use
of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(linguistics)"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; (like
“ah” and “um”), which I used to say excessively and which would make
me cringe at my talk videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to explain why I normally disregard conference templates: In
preparing and delivering my talks, I try to put a greater emphasis on
accessibility that I used to before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my slides are now all high-contrast. I default to using &lt;a href="https://fghaas.github.io/cookiecutter-presentation/#/3"&gt;black text
  on a white
  background&lt;/a&gt;
  (this is a good default for when I have reason to assume the
  projection equipment will be less than perfect), alternatively I use
  white text on a black background (for darkened rooms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to accommodate people with the most common types of color
  blindness: I use blue — as opposed to red or green – as my highlight
  color, and in
  &lt;a href="https://fghaas.github.io/cephalocon2019-rbdmirror/#/8/2"&gt;charts&lt;/a&gt;, I
  differentiate by both color and line stroke. I also try to refrain
  from using animations. As for slide transitions, I use only fade, no
  motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I publish my slides ahead of time, include a QR code at the very
  beginning, and I use reveal.js Multiplex so that my slides advance
  in unison with those one people’s phones, tablets, or laptops. This
  way, people with less-than-perfect vision (or simply seated in an
  unfortunate spot, at the back of the room) can follow along easily
  and and their own preferred zoom level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my speaker notes are fully written out, this means that I can
  also &lt;a href="https://fghaas.github.io/cookiecutter-presentation/#/intro"&gt;include
  them&lt;/a&gt; in
  the published material, so that my notes can act as subtitles for my
  speaking. This can come in handy to people who are hard of hearing,
  or who are simply unaccustomed to my accent or manner of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve rolled these accessibility considerations into my opinionated,
&lt;a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/"&gt;Cookiecutter&lt;/a&gt;-based reveal.js
&lt;a href="https://github.com/fghaas/cookiecutter-presentation"&gt;presentation
generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A request&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be visually impaired, or color blind, or hard of
hearing, or you work with people who are – in other words, if you can
make a suggestion for me to improve the accessibility of my slides,
&lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/fghaas/cookiecutter-presentation/issues"&gt;file an
issue&lt;/a&gt;
against my Cookiecutter and I’ll try to work that in as best I
can.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional skill-building is challenging, particularly when the
skill to acquire is about distributed, scalable platform
technology. In this talk, I cover an open-source skill-building
platform that is 100% Python: built on Open edX and heavily involving
Django, Ansible, and OpenStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information technology industry is currently dealing with an
interesting challenge in professional skill-building: almost every new
technology developed in recent years has been complex, distributed,
and built for scale: Kubernetes, Ceph, and OpenStack can serve as just
a few representative examples. Loose coupling, asynchronicity, and
elasticity are just some of the qualities frequently found in such
systems that were entirely absent in many of the systems we built only
a few years ago. As a result, people comfortable with building and
operating these complex systems are hardly found in abundance, and
organisations frequently struggle to adopt these technologies as a
direct result of this scarcity: we are dealing with a skills gap, not
a technology gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we need novel ways to educate professionals on these
technologies. We must provide professional learners with complex,
distributed systems to use as realistic learning environments, and we
must enable them to learn from anywhere, at any time, and on their own
pace. One excellent way of doing this is to use the capabilities of
the Open edX platform to integrate a learning management system with
hands-on, on-demand lab environments that can be just as complex, and
just as distributed, as production systems. This allows anyone
interested to develop a professional skill set on novel technology at
minimal cost, and without the need for costly hardware platforms for
evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will give a rapid technical introduction to the core
components of this free and open source (AGPL 3/ASL 2) all-Python
platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edx-platform, the core learning management system (LMS) and content
  management system (CMS), built on Django;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edx-configuration, the automated deployment facility to roll out the
  Open edX platform, built on Ansible;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and finally, the Open edX XBlock extension system and its
  integration with OpenStack, also itself an all-Python cloud
  platform, in order to provide on-demand lab environments from both
  private and public cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will only be shown to organisers and reviewers. You should
provide any details about your proposal that you don't want to be
public here. This field is rendered with the monospace font Hack

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come from a background in technical consulting and instructor-driven
professional education, and together with my team have been building
and deploying Open edX based platforms as described in the talk
since 2015. I believe I have a good understanding on why
instructor-driven training, while desirable, is not accessible to
everyone in need of keeping abreast with technology development, and
that a self-paced, learn-from-anywhere alternative is needed. I am
extremely grateful for the fact that we have an very well-suited
platform for that purpose, and since it has a completely open-source,
Python codebase, it might be of interest to LCA attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done a talk on a similar topic at the LCA 2018 Education
miniconf (video link included below). In the 2018 talk, I focused
primarily on the educational aspects of self-paced, on-line
training. This time, and I think more appropriately for the main
conference track, I would like to dive into the nuts and bolts of the
platform that drives this. As such, the talk should still be appealing
to people engaged in professional education (be it as learners,
tutors, or instructional designers), but will also be insightful to
Python and OpenStack developers, and heavy Ansible users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
"elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStack’s complexity comes with operational challenges. And in
situations where OpenStack misbehaves, it is frequently non-trivial to
find the actual cause of an issue. This talk includes several examples
of red herrings in OpenStack, and suggestions for spotting
and avoiding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk (&amp;gt;30-45 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audience Level&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field supports Markdown. The description will be seen by
reviewers during the CFP process and may eventually be seen by the
attendees of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should make the description of your talk as compelling and
exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers
of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince
attendees your talk is the one they should see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with OpenStack, you deal with an environment that is
inherently complex. As with all complex environments, things sometimes
go wrong or behave unexpectedly. And when &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; happens, your
immediate goal is to locate, pinpoint, and then troubleshoot the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, sometimes, you go down the dead-wrong path, and end up
chasing a red herring for some time, before you find the real
problem. This talk contains examples of such red herrings, enabling
you to recognize and avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is both for those who &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; an OpenStack cloud, and those
who &lt;em&gt;consume&lt;/em&gt; its functionality as a service. It talks about both red
herrings in OpenStack operations, and red herrings in operating
applications &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;  OpenStack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field supports Markdown. Notes will only be seen by reviewers
during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such
as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on
this subject, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on OpenStack since 2012, have consulted on lots of
private and public cloud deployments using OpenStack, and I work for
the operator of a multi-region global OpenStack Cloud. “I've seen
things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the
shoulder of Orion...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to what &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; have seen, others have seen other things,
which is why I am crowdsourcing the content of this talk. That being
so, the talk proposal &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/talk-submissions/oidn-2019-red-herrings/"&gt;is
public&lt;/a&gt;,
and I am asking people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/1126030330937380864"&gt;on
Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to
send me their stories, which I will add to and mix with my own, with
due attribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give one example of what I would like to cover, see &lt;a href="https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/hints-and-kinks/1000-routers-per-tenant-think-again/"&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;
on my web site, which talks about how you can run into what looks like
a quota issue in Neutron, but whose cause is in fact buried deep in
&lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5798"&gt;RFC 5798&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag your talk to make it easier for event organizers to be able to
find. Examples are "ruby, javascript, rails".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Title&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One For All: Using Terraform to manage OpenStack and Kubernetes
resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
"elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hands-on introduction to Terraform in an OpenStack and Kubernetes
context. Get the basics (of Terraform), then spin up a Kubernetes
cluster in an OpenStack public cloud (with Terraform), and manage
resources on it (with Terraform).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workshop (&amp;gt;60 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audience Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field supports Markdown. The description will be seen by
reviewers during the CFP process and may eventually be seen by the
attendees of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should make the description of your talk as compelling and
exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers
of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince
attendees your talk is the one they should see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in deployment automation for arbitrarily complex
containerized microservice applications, this is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, you will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get to know the basics of &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/"&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; and
  &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/"&gt;Terraform
  configurations&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spin up a Kubernetes cluster with Terraform, using the &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/"&gt;OpenStack
  provider&lt;/a&gt; and
  interfacing with &lt;a href="https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/latest/user/"&gt;OpenStack
  Magnum&lt;/a&gt; in a public
  cloud,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start managing Kubernetes resources from Terraform, using the
  &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/"&gt;Kubernetes
  provider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll walk away with a solid understanding of Terraform's
capabilities, enabling you to make an informed decision of whether
Terraform is a suitable deployment automation facility for your
organization's needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior Terraform knowledge is not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field supports Markdown. Notes will only be seen by reviewers
during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such
as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on
this subject, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no technical requirements other than internet connectivity,
and a web browser (preferably on a laptop, though a reasonably-sized
tablet with a modern browser should work as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag your talk to make it easier for event organizers to be able to
find. Examples are "ruby, javascript, rails".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

organizing a grassroots knowledge-sharing conference. But if I did run
one, and I could shape it exactly as I wanted, this might be what it
would look like. Please be advised that I have no idea what I am
talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about Nonexisticon, the non-existent conference. Just to
benefit your reading flow, dear reader, I am using the indicative
rather than the subjunctive mood, in other words, I use phrases like
“Nonexisticon &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;” as opposed to “Nonexisticon &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I
trust that you are not confused by this, as the name very clearly
implies that the conference does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unifying Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon’s theme is freely shared knowledge work. &lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon
brings together open-data researchers, open-source software and
hardware engineers and designers, Creative Commoners, documentarians,
writers, artists, educators.&lt;/strong&gt; Basically, if you create something with
your mind and you make your creation freely available for anyone to
use, enhance, modify and build upon, you’re welcome at
Nonexisticon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is also a mutually supportive conference, where
corporate-funded or financially secure attendees can commit to
supporting less-privileged ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Location and Reach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon is a regional conference.&lt;/strong&gt; “Region” in this context
means an area from which the conference attendees can reasonably
travel to the conference location, using environmentally friendly
transportation modes (such as high-speed rail). Attendance from
outside the region is welcome, but for environmental reasons it is not
encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is typically held on a university campus, or other
suitable facility, in a location well accessible by public
transportation. Cheap accommodation is typically available on-campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supporting Organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is organized by the Nonexisticon Association, a
not-for-profit organization that allows only individual, not corporate
membership. The organization is staffed by volunteers, that is to say,
while it is authorized to reimburse members of the conference team for
expenses incurred and income lost as a direct result of conference
work, it does not pay salaries to its staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon registration includes membership in this organization,
with full voting rights, for a period of two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recurrence and Length&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any regional Nonexisticon has its own recurrence schedule, but the
conference is never held in the same region more than &lt;strong&gt;once per
year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Nonexisticon has a general theme. Themes can be quite diverse and
are generally broadly defined, so as to attract individuals from many
disciplines and backgrounds (as long as they relate to the unifying
theme of freely shared knowledge work). Examples for conference themes
are “cancer research”, “the Python programming language”, “high-energy
physics”, or “the arts in education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is run by a Conference Committee, which is a &lt;strong&gt;group of 5
individuals headed by a Conference Director.&lt;/strong&gt; The Conference
Committee serves for the run-up, duration, and wind-down of one
Nonexisticon, oversees the appointment of the succeeding Committee,
and acts as advisors to the incoming Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would-be Conference Committees prepare a bid for the next
Nonexisticon. Bids specify the conference location, dates, venue,
capacity, theme, proposed sponsorship opportunities, and budget. If a
bid is uncontested, the prior Conference Committee merely assesses the
bid for plausibility and compliance with formal criteria, and accepts
the bid (thereby also appointing the new Conference Committee). If
more than one bid exists, the outgoing Conference Committee organizes
an on-line vote among the Association membership, using a preferential
voting system. The winning bid then results in the appointment of the
new Conference Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Presentations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is a &lt;strong&gt;single-track conference, with one presentation
slot length available: 30 minutes.&lt;/strong&gt; Nonexisticon typically runs over
the course of &lt;strong&gt;three days,&lt;/strong&gt; with talks scheduled between 09:00 (9am)
and 18:00 (6pm) local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that after deducting conference opening and closing
remarks, keynotes, and breaks, &lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon has 38 talks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in
total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q&amp;amp;A time is at the speaker’s discretion; forgoing Q&amp;amp;A entirely is
acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All presentations are &lt;strong&gt;open for rating&lt;/strong&gt; by attendees for a short
time period of 5 minutes prior to, and 15 minutes after scheduled
conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations are &lt;strong&gt;recorded&lt;/strong&gt; by a professional A/V team, and
publicly released under a permissive license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Presentation Proposals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon uses an &lt;strong&gt;anonymized call for proposals (CFP),&lt;/strong&gt;
conducted online, using an open-source conference platform. The
Conference Committee defines the format of the CFP proper, including
the questions posed at submitters. The Conference Committee reviews
all submitted proposals, anonymized, for formal compliance with the
CFP only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon attendance &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; the submission of a presentation
proposal.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus, conference registration and presentation submission
are one and the same process. The conference registration fee must be
paid in full at the time of registration/submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon limits proposals to one per speaker/attendee. All
presentations are solo; multi-presenter talks and panel discussions
are not permitted.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Underprivileged Attendee Fund&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prospective attendees unable to accommodate the registration fee,
conference travel, or accommodation&lt;/strong&gt; may apply, upon registration, to
the Underprivileged Attendee Fund.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If accepted (per decision by the
Conference Committee), the speaker/attendee is invited to attend the
conference free of charge, and their submitted presentation is
included in proposal review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Underprivileged Attendee Fund is endowed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;corporate conference sponsorship,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;donations to the Nonexisticon Association,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profits carried over from prior conferences,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;donations from regular speaker-attendees who voluntarily put up
  double the regular application fee upon their own
  registration/proposal submission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Review process and talk selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talks are selected by all attendees/speakers&lt;/strong&gt; during a time-limited
selection period using a &lt;a href="http://www.deborda.org/faq/voting-systems/what-is-a-modified-borda-count.html"&gt;modified Borda count
(MBC)&lt;/a&gt;
ranking process, as pioneered by the scientific community &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.1943"&gt;for
allocating observation time on astronomical
telescopes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, every attendee is assigned a small, randomly selected
set of proposals (about 10, and excluding their own submission) to
review. They then rank these submissions not in an order of
subjectively “best” to “worst”, but from &lt;em&gt;most beneficial to the overall
attendee community&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;least beneficial to the overall attendee
community.&lt;/em&gt; This results in an overall preliminary ranking of
submissions, which is then compared to each attendee’s individual
ranking. A high degree of agreement of an individual attendee’s
ranking with the overall preliminary tally results in additional
points for the attendee’s own proposal; the contrary, in subtracted
points. Ultimately, this produces a final, definitive ranking of all
received proposals.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire ranking process is automated using open-source software,
and both the preliminary and the final ranking result are publicized
to all attendees/submitters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submitters of the 48 top-ranked presentations (38 plus 10
backup/waitlist presentations) are refunded their registration fee
upon acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an accepted speaker needs to withdraw their talk, the next-ranked
talk automatically moves up, and the speaker’s registration is
simultaneously canceled.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Budget and Sponsoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon’s budget calls for a barebones conference (infrastructure
only, no catering, no childcare) to break even solely on
registration fees equivalent to two-thirds of the venue capacity. In
case of registrations being in excess of this threshold, Nonexisticon
funds childcare, refreshments, and catered lunch, in that order.&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon is open to sponsoring. Sponsoring, however, does not buy
presentation slots, nor does it have any bearing on keynote
selection. Sponsors can choose to contribute to infrastructure,
catering, childcare, the Underprivileged Attendee Fund, and social
events. Of these, social events are the only category open
&lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; to sponsor funding; Nonexisticon does not spend
registration fee revenue on social events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If registrations do not meet the two-thirds threshold, and the budget
shortfall cannot be compensated by sponsor contributions or profits
carried over from prior conferences, the conference is cancelled and
registration fees refunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonexisticon has one keynote, which opens the conference.&lt;/strong&gt; The
Conference Committee extends the keynote speaker invitation by
consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing “keynote” is a reprise of the highest-rated presentation
in the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference run-up timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonexisticon’s attendee-visible run-up cycle is 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a Nonexisticon is scheduled to run from May 15-17, the
following schedule applies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disclaimer and acknowledgments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to reiterate that I have no experience whatsoever in running
or putting on a conference, since the only time I’ve contributed to
them as something other than a mere speaker, I’ve sat on proposal
selection committees. So take all of what I wrote above with a
mountain of salt, and consider it nothing more than semi-elaborate
handwaving full of glaring omissions. But if you do want to give me
some feedback, even it is simply telling me &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; my ideas are nuts —
as opposed to just &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; they are — I’d be most grateful. Find me on
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xahteiwi"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, thanks to &lt;a href="https://tom.eastman.nz/"&gt;Tom Eastman&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1121515902833311745"&gt;prompting
me&lt;/a&gt; to put
this in writing, to &lt;a href="https://about.me/michael.merrifield"&gt;Professor Mike
Merrifield&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7c0CoXFApnM"&gt;introducing me
to the MBC approach&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href="http://www.bradyharan.com/"&gt;Brady
Haran&lt;/a&gt; for making the
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A"&gt;Numberphile&lt;/a&gt;
YouTube channel where I learned about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear grammar stickler, I am acutely aware that a phrase
including &lt;em&gt;would + infinitive&lt;/em&gt; is not a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; subjunctive
mood, but the use of a modal verb. Feel free to replace all such
instances with a true subjunctive in your head. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t bother to check the talk arithmetic. It doesn’t matter
whether it’s really 36 talks or 41 or 42. I just picked 38 as a
reasonable, concrete number to work with. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disallowing multiple submissions from one person, and
presentations with multiple speakers, is a necessary consequence
of the talk selection process. Allowing only one submission per
submitter also has the added benefit that prospective speakers can
focus on one single talk and give the proposal their very best
shot. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a better name for this? &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find this summary insufficient to explain the process but
also don’t feel like plowing through the paper, here’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7c0CoXFApnM"&gt;a video

information&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is admittedly harsh to only be able to pull out of an
accepted talk by pulling out of the conference altogether. I
consider this a necessary evil to ensure that no
attendee/submitter submit their proposal without genuine intent to
present. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, I am most on the fence about childcare. Meaning it
would probably be a good idea to always budget for child-care
cost, even if that means a higher registration fee for everyone,
and thus a slightly elevated risk of conference cancellation. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="https://linux.conf.au/"&gt;linux.conf.au&lt;/a&gt; 2019. The conference uses a
non-anonymized CfP process on a custom platform that, &lt;em&gt;I think,&lt;/em&gt; is
built on &lt;a href="https://symposion.readthedocs.io/"&gt;Symposion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was accepted as a &lt;em&gt;standby talk,&lt;/em&gt; meaning it was slated to
fill the gap if any other talk had to be cancelled on short notice. I
did prepare the full talk, though it did not end up presenting it at
the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also submitted the talk to &lt;a href="https://2019.djangocon.eu"&gt;DjangoCon Europe
2019&lt;/a&gt;, where it was rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a personal story. It does not claim to be rooted in
statistical analysis or scientific rigour, and the evidence presented
is anecdotal. But it might be insightful to anyone joining, leaving,
or interacting with a remote team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2017, I ran a company that had no office. Everyone worked
from home, and apart from an annual one-week face to face meeting, all
our communications were remote. In 2017, I sold my company and
integrated my team into a company that had previously been working
exclusively out of a single office. As one would expect, the
integration was not without friction (they never are), but what
emerged from the experience was a better understanding of the
challenges that come with a mixed office/remote work environment, and
some rules to address them. In this talk, I'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical misconceptions that remoties have about office-workers, and
  vice versa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the right tools for the right type of communications:
  interactive chat, email, wiki, issue trackers, Kanban boards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timezones, and communications around scheduling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5-paragraph format, a simple tool I habitually use to make sure
  everyone is on the same page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow-up and follow-through, and how to make sure neither you, nor
  your team, nor your boss loses sight of what needs doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

provide any details about your proposal that you don't want to be
public here. This field is rendered with the monospace font Hack

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's probably good for me to reiterate that this is not a scientific study. :)&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have spoken at tech conferences for the better part of a decade, and
up to this point I have only ever published &lt;a href="/category/presentations.html"&gt;my
talks&lt;/a&gt; after I’ve actually presented
them. I’ll change that from here on out, and I’ll instead record any
talk that I &lt;em&gt;submit&lt;/em&gt; to a conference instead, regardless of whether it
ultimately gets accepted or not. I do this for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d like to have a record of my talk submissions for my own
   reference purposes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s rather remarkable how many conference talk submission systems
exist that make it rather difficult to retrieve your submitted
abstract a few months or years after the conference. Some event
websites exist specifically for one instance of a particular
conference, so they might be taken down a few months after, and
unaccepted abstracts are usually not accessible publicly — so even
getting them via the &lt;a href="https://archive.org/"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; is
not an option. Others record talk submissions via Google Forms,
into a private Google Sheet, and don’t send an autoreply
containing the full submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I use this site for having my own record of talks I submit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t want to reinforce the illusion that just because I’m an
    experienced speaker, all talks I submit anywhere get accepted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get talks rejected all the time, &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; from conferences
I’d &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoy speaking at. This is normal, and if any of you
reading this are less experienced and find rejections
discouraging, I want you to know that they happen to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am curious about other people’s thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a speaker, it is pretty hard to get good feedback on a talk
submission. Very few conferences send you detailed feedback on
rejected talks. And none at all, to the best of my knowledge, send
you qualitative feedback on &lt;em&gt;accepted&lt;/em&gt; ones (other than “congrats,
you’re in!”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figure that if I publish my submissions here, perhaps a few
people might take a look and chip in some valuable thoughts. And
even though &lt;a href="/comments/"&gt;this site doesn’t do comments&lt;/a&gt;, I am
counting on Twitter and other social networks to spark some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you run a small conference or meetup that I don’t know about,
    I want to give you the opportunity to reach out to me if there’s a
    topic you’d like to hear me talk about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s generally far more topics that I’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to do talks on —
and feel reasonably qualified to — than what I often get selected
to speak about. In addition, there are &lt;em&gt;just so many&lt;/em&gt; conferences
and meetups out there that it’s impossible to keep track of all of
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you find a topic here that you’d really like at &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt;
event that I absolutely don’t have on my radar, do drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you find any of my talk ideas useful, go ahead and submit your
   own talk like it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like almost all content on this site, the talk submissions I
record here are
&lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en"&gt;CC-BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;
licensed, so as long as you include an acknowledgment, and
reciprocate by sharing your own talk, please do consider yourself
encouraged to build your own talk ideas from mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll make one exception from this rule:&lt;/strong&gt; some conferences use an
anonymized talk selection process, where submissions must be devoid of
any information that might be remotely likely to identify the
speaker. If I submit a talk to such a conference, I’ll only put the
abstract up here when the selection process is over, the schedule
stands, and I have received a definitive acceptance or rejection
notice. However, in case I am re-submitting a talk previously given at
(or previously submitted to) a different conference, I won’t be
removing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my (continuously updated) list of talk submissions
&lt;a href="/category/talk-submissions.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s also an Atom

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writing for learners: best practices for creating, developing, and
maintaining self-paced learning resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information here is better. Submitting a single paragraph won't
give us much to go on, but please no walls of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation talks about a special kind of tech writing: creating
and maintaining self-paced technical training content. This
encompasses both prose for theoretical background information, and
instructions for hands-on labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll go over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;special challenges (and advantages!) of self-directed over
  instructor-driven training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;video content, and why we don’t do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our rules for structuring theoretical content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our approach for interactive lab instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is rooted in 4 years’ experience in writing courseware used for
learning complex technical topics (like OpenStack, Kubernetes, Ceph,
and others) on an Open edX platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll find the concepts discussed in this talk useful if you write
courseware (of course), but I’d say they equally apply whenever you
find yourself writing any content that is instructive, rather than
descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who and why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is this talk for? What background knowledge or experience do you
expect the audience to have? What is the take away from the talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for anyone who, in a technical context, uses
imperatives. I’ve been at least a part-time tech writer for the better
part of the last 10 years, but I’ve written software documentation for
only 4 of those – the majority of the remainder I’ve written
courseware content instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing prose training content and lab instructions comes with its own
unique challenges and its own (explicit or implicit) style
guide. Since as courseware authors we communicate with our learners
exclusively in writing, I believe I have good practices to share with
other documentarians who might occasionally find themselves in the
situation of writing lab instructions and test scenario descriptions,
and I think there are equally many things that can learn from other
talks and speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other information that might be interesting for us to know about
you? Give a lightning talk last year, speak at a WTD meetup, or
anything else interesting? Add it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never spoken at any Write The Docs conference, though I have done
talks and workshops at multiple instances of linux.conf.au, LinuxCon
(now Open Source Summit), OpenStack Summit (now Open Infrastructure
Summit), the Open edX Conference, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team and I maintain City Cloud Academy (academy.citycloud.com),
which runs on Open edX.&lt;/p&gt;

interactive steps presented. Please note: the process, while simple, is
extremely bandwidth intensive and you don't want to be the bandwidth hog
that everyone hates in your hotel, or on a conference wifi. Do so in
your office (or home) instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set-up process is decribed in &lt;a href="https://github.com/fghaas/perconalive2014/blob/master/README.md"&gt;a brief
README&lt;/a&gt;.
Effectively, it boils down to cloning a Git repo and then running
vagrant up, and you'll be good to go. But do pay attention to the system
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our talk, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;More reliable, more resilient, more redundant: High
Availability Update for Grizzly and beyond,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an extended overview
about current and future high availability features in OpenStack. It
covers infrastructure high availability, HA features in Nova, Quantum,
and several other topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've given a shorter version of this talk &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/resources/presentations/high-availability-update-grizzly-and-havana"&gt;just this week, at the 2nd
Swiss OpenStack User Group
meetup,&lt;/a&gt;
where apparently &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/zhgeeks/events/97648722/"&gt;around 55 people liked it a
lot.&lt;/a&gt; You can take a
look at the slides
&lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/resources/presentations/high-availability-update-grizzly-and-havana"&gt;here,&lt;/a&gt;
and there will also be a video that should be available later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make sure that this talk makes it into the Summit, we need your
help! Voting for Summit sessions is up, and you can vote for our talk
&lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/vote-for-speakers/presentation/531"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;
Please note, you must be an OpenStack Foundation member to vote. If
you're not, and you're into OpenStack, you can &lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org/join/register/"&gt;join (for free!) as an
Individual Member.&lt;/a&gt; Then, you
can immediately &lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/vote-for-speakers/presentation/531"&gt;proceed to the voting

to cast your vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, November 7, is a day full of tutorials at LinuxCon Europe. I
am presenting &lt;a href="http://linuxconeurope2012.sched.org/event/83ef77ad003a026246f37e639cd562db"&gt;Hands-On with Ceph: Object Storage, Block Storage,
Filesystem &amp;amp;
More&lt;/a&gt;,
a deep dive into the Ceph stack. This is a double-slot tutorial,
scheduled for 2:45 - 4:25pm in the Verdi room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on Thursday, the GlusterFS community team has invited me to speak
at the &lt;a href="http://linuxconeurope2012.sched.org/overview/type/gluster+workshop"&gt;Gluster
Workshop.&lt;/a&gt; This
workshop is complimentary to &lt;a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe/attend/register"&gt;registered LinuxCon Europe
attendees&lt;/a&gt;,
but you can also &lt;a href="https://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1109147"&gt;register
separately&lt;/a&gt;
just for the workshop. In that talk, I'll speak about &lt;a href="http://linuxconeurope2012.sched.org/event/2b898583721726bd6a8d8e15af2084d8"&gt;GlusterFS in High
Availability Clusters: Integration with the Pacemaker HA
Stack&lt;/a&gt;.
It's also a 1-hour slot, from 10 - 11am in Vivaldi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty excited about this trip: it's close to home, it's a great
conference, and I've never been to Barcelona before. So, if you're
headed there, please &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/users/florian/contact"&gt;drop me a

brand new, stack-agnostic cloud conference where OpenStackers can mingle
with CloudStackers and Eucalyptus folks to discuss open-source cloud
solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also the conference where I will be giving my fourth (and likely
last, at least for the time being) incarnation of the High Availability
for OpenStack talk I first delivered at the Folsom design summit back in
April. Since then, we've had a lot of community involvement for HA in
OpenStack, and have made some excellent progress, and I will be more
than happy to report on that. This presentation is on &lt;a href="http://cloudopen2012.sched.org/event/06939ee7fd5fe48bf202525bbd7e506d#.UDIX9hXwh2M"&gt;Thursday,
2:25-3:10pm in Executsoemive Center Room
2&lt;/a&gt;,
in the &lt;em&gt;Operations&lt;/em&gt; track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://ceph.com/community/people-profile/sage-weil/"&gt;Sage Weil&lt;/a&gt;
of Ceph fame is joining me for an birds-of-a-feather (BoF) session on
Ceph. &lt;a href="http://rtrk.us/"&gt;Ross Turk&lt;/a&gt; and I had such an excellent turnout
(and a great time) in the Ceph BoF at OSCON that we just had to do
another. And Sage agreed to take part, which is excellent. He has &lt;a href="http://cloudopen2012.sched.org/event/f3e84388068b1855c5a705a97c917f44#.UDIZeBXwh2M"&gt;a
talk on Ceph in the main conference
track&lt;/a&gt;
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference organizers do not announce BoF sessions ahead of time on
the CloudOpen web site, so I've simply &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cq28o7cvj9dg1ki1om3clfo8700/110443614427234590648"&gt;set up a Google+
event&lt;/a&gt;
for you to check in on. The exact location is still TBD (we will be
assigned a room based on availability), but we will definitely be in the
conference area at the Sheraton in San Diego. If you're attending
CloudOpen and you want to learn more about Ceph, you're more than
welcome to join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal CloudOpen schedule is available
&lt;a href="http://cloudopen2012.sched.org/fghaas"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, by the way. Feel free to
grab me at a talk, or in the hallway. See you in San Diego!&lt;/p&gt;

and am finally getting rid of my jet lag. Here's a summary of what's
been a mind-blowing conference experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first OpenStack Design Summit and Conference. And as anyone
who's in open source …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've just returned from the &lt;a href="http://www.openstack.org/conference/san-francisco-2012/"&gt;OpenStack Folsom Design Summit and Spring
2012
Conference&lt;/a&gt;,
and am finally getting rid of my jet lag. Here's a summary of what's
been a mind-blowing conference experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first OpenStack Design Summit and Conference. And as anyone
who's in open source is acutely aware, some communities can be reluctant
to accept newcomers. Some may even seem outright hostile to the timid.
Not the &lt;a href="http://www.openstack.org/community"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute I sat down in the opening session of the Design Summit on
Monday, I felt instantly welcome and at home. Even as a relative
OpenStack newbie (who was invited to the Design Summit to provide some
insights and guidance on high availability), I immediately got the
impression that I was in the right place at the right time. I've rarely
seen a developer community on such a positive vibe. Sure, we'll blast
each other on technical disagreements, but all in a good-natured, fun
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://folsomdesignsummit2012.sched.org/event/fa2a5803a4b4ba857db57c84a1e1d3bc"&gt;My own Design Summit
session&lt;/a&gt;
clearly wasn't without such disagreements, and expectedly so. But I
think we came to some excellent conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure high availability will be an overarching design goal
    in the upcoming OpenStack Folsom release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will shoot for providing HA solutions for all OpenStack
    infrastructure services. This includes MySQL, RabbitMQ, Glance,
    Keystone, Nova and Horizon (Swift already has HA built in). hastexo
    will play a very active role in this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not reinvent the wheel, and instead rely on &lt;a href="http://clusterlabs.org/"&gt;the Pacemaker
    stack&lt;/a&gt; wherever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the challenge is really in the documentation and in the
    development of reference solutions that deployment solutions
    (&lt;a href="https://jujucharms.com/"&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.com/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;) can then build on. We will take a
    lot of responsibility in that effort, as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some services still require some work to become fully HA capable.
    Cinder (the volume service that's being factored out of Nova for
    Folsom) is one example, Quantum is another. This work will be
    tackled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're currently planning to stop short of providing monitoring and
    HA for Nova instances (a.k.a. &lt;em&gt;guest HA&lt;/em&gt;). This is on the list for
    the next release past Folsom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those issues discussed, voted on and on the record, I had the honor
of &lt;a href="http://openstackconferencespring2012.sched.org/event/a6d940d2ebd11e37c6ac389f7d4d2125"&gt;presenting them to a larger audience at the main
conference&lt;/a&gt;.
It seems to have hit home pretty well, based on feedback from attendees
given in-person and on Twitter. &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;I'm hoping the conference
organizers will make a video recording available shortly. Meanwhile, my
presentation is already available
&lt;a href="https://prezi.com/gxaohiwl46z2/high-availability-in-openstack/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hastexo.com/resources/presentations/reliable-redundant-resilient-high-availability-openstack"&gt;It's
now available here in the &lt;em&gt;Presentations&lt;/em&gt;
section.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this has been a wonderful and very well organized conference,
and I'm very much looking forward to coming back next time around.&lt;/p&gt;

April 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This of course means that you should totally &lt;a href="http://www.openstack.org/conference/san-francisco-2012/register/"&gt;register for the
conference&lt;/a&gt;
if you haven't already done so, and I'll be happy to chat with anyone
interested in OpenStack HA. See you in San Francisco!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacemaker author Andrew Beekhof dropped in as well, to field questions
and provide additional insight into Pacemaker development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial covers the configuration of a MySQL 2-node high
availability cluster front to back, diving into the configuration of
replicated storage, the cluster communications infrastructure, cluster
resource management, and of course the MySQL database itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews for this tutorial were rather enthusiastic, with bloggers
comparing the experience to &lt;a href="http://www.anchor.com.au/blog/2012/01/lca-day-3-high-availability/"&gt;an enlightenment session from the Jedi
grand
masters&lt;/a&gt;
of high availability.&lt;/p&gt;

Expo as a speaker. Percona have picked up the torch that O'Reilly had
held as the conference organizers, and they're putting together a 3-day
conference this year. I am co-presenting a tutorial with Yves Trudeau
from Percona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tutorial is called &lt;a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/mysql-high-availability-deep-dive-pacemaker-drbd-mysql-replication-and-more"&gt;High Availability Deep Dive: Pacemaker, DRBD,
MySQL Replication, and
more!&lt;/a&gt; and
it's going to be the only full-day tutorial offered in this year's
conference. In it, Yves and I are going to cover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    An overview of the Pacemaker cluster stack (the classic "this is
    Pacemaker" introduction)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;
DRBD-backed MySQL replication (another classic and widely deployed
scenario)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;
MySQL replication under Pacemaker management (a new option which
Yves has vastly improved through a big patch set to the MySQL RA).
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I expect this talk to be controversial? Definitely. The amount of
"Pacemaker is terrible" and "Pacemaker is unsuitable for managing highly
available databases" that has been around the blogosphere lately is
pretty mind-boggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strangely enough, most of the things brought forward against
Pacemaker by its detractors seem like a time-warp back to about 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    "We must use XML to manage Pacemaker!" Nonsense. In fact, that was
    &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; true – the release of Pacemaker as a separate project and
    the release of the crm shell coincided. Ever since, Pacemaker
    configuration has been as text-based as MySQL itself.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;
"All Pacemaker can do is react to node failure!" Nothing could be
further from the truth. Pacemaker has some of the most sophisticated
resource monitoring and auto-recovery capabilities under the sun.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;
"OK. But all it can do to react to &lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt; failure is kill a
daemon!" Bogus again. It will happily do whatever the resource agent
specifies. Or the admin, through the configuration. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our tutorial, we're going to dispel a few of these myths. We
certainly make no claims as to Pacemaker being the one and only solution
for MySQL HA, but it's one that serves lots of use cases excellently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I'll also hang around for the conference proper, and
I'm very much looking forward to seeing lots of familiar faces. I'll
also remain in the Bay Area for some time after the MySQL conference –
more on that in a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;
