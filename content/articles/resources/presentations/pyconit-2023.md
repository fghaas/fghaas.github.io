Summary: PyCon Italia 2023 was wonderful. Here's my talk.

This year, I traveled to
[Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence) for my first
[PyConÂ Italia](https://pycon.it/). It's a wonderful conference in a
lovely city, and I hope to return.

PyCon Italia accepted my Creativity talk that I'd already done at
[DevOpsDays Tel Aviv the prior
December]({filename}devopsdaystlv-2022.md), and I was *much* happier
with it the second time around.

Also, thankfully I did not have the audio issues that plagued the Tel
Aviv talk, so the recording came out rather well, too.
It is available [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/dKuGRV0hlA0). My
slides (with full speaker notes) are available
