Summary: PyCon Italia 2023 was wonderful. Here's my talk.

This year, I traveled to
[Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence) for my first
[PyConÂ Italia](https://pycon.it/). It's a wonderful conference in a
lovely city, and I hope to return.

PyCon Italia accepted my Creativity talk that I'd already done at
[DevOpsDays Tel Aviv the prior
December]({filename}devopsdaystlv-2022.md), and I was *much* happier
with it the second time around.

Also, thankfully I did not have the audio issues that plagued the Tel
Aviv talk, so the recording came out rather well, too.

PyCon Italia hasn't yet released edited videos for the talks, but you
can already catch the [unedited recording of the live
stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/nUmolZkWQIg?feature=share&t=22847). My
slides (with full speaker notes) are available
