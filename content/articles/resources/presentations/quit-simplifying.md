Summary: A talk I gave at two different conferences, in Belgium and Italy.

This is a talk about complexity that I did twice in 2024:

First, I presented it at Config Management Camp in Ghent in February.
A recording is [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/lchJi2B_DlE).

Then, I reprised it at PyCon Italia in Florence in May.
That talk is also [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/KlE-VyUYLts), and I like that recording slightly better.

My slides (with full speaker notes) are available [here](https://fghaas.github.io/quit-simplifying/).
