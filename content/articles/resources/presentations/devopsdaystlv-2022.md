Summary: I did a 30-minute Spotlight Talk at DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2022.

This year, [DevOpsDays Tel Aviv](https://devopsdaystlv.com) accepted
my talk on creativity (which I submitted as a 20-minute session), and
then upgraded it to a 30-minute Spotlight Talk on the main stage to
close out the first day.

This was my first DevOpsDays Tel Aviv [since
2019]({filename}devopsdaystlv-2019.md), and the event has grown
significantly since then. It is still a 2-day event that is mostly
single-track save for some workshops, but it now takes up all of
Pavilion 10 of the Tel Aviv Expo, including an 800-seat main stage
keynote area.

The video for this talk [on Youtube](https://youtu.be/gUurzz49j8c),
but unfortunately it has pretty bad audio issues so it's a bit painful
to listen to. My slides (with full speaker notes) are available
[here](https://fghaas.github.io/devopsdaystlv-2022/).
