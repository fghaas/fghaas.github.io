Summary: I've done this for several other cities. It figures I should do one for mine.

I've been asked to finally add an entry in this series for my hometown.
Of course, these are not necessarily touristy places, nor are they stereotypically Viennese or Austrian, nor particularly upscale. They're just good.

## Gorilla Kitchen

It's not easy to find a good burrito in this city, but this place definitely has them.
This is just a stone's throw from Karlskirche and a short walk from the Karlsplatz U-Bahn station.

All burritos are made to order.
They have meaty and vegan options, and 3 degrees of spice in the sauce.

## On

[Wehrgasse 8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uN35dabvT7M93pca9)

My favourite Chinese place in Vienna, equal distance (about 7 minutes' walk) from the Kettenbrückengasse and Pilgramgrasse U-Bahn stops.

Not your typical buffet-style Chinese restaurant, but rather a lovely a la carte place.
Their menu includes ingredients not typically served in more mainstream Chinese restaurants in Europe, such as lamb liver, tripes, or frog legs.

## Kent

Vienna has many, many Turkish restaurants, but this is my favourite by a large margin.
You can swing by for takeaway from their charcoal grill, but it's also a nice place for a sit-down dinner with friends.

Kent has [multiple locations around the city](https://www.kentrestaurant.at/), but for some reason the one on Märzstraße (right next to the Schweglerstraße U-Bahn station) has always been my preferred one.
