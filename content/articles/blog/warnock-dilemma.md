Title: Warnock’s Dilemma, Objections, and Acknowledgements

Summary: “Warnock’s Dilemma” is a classic feature of distributed, asynchronous, online communications. You can’t avoid it, you can’t work around it, but you can deal with it with two simple changes to your communicative behavior.

People skeptical of distributed, asynchronous, written communications
sometimes make the understandable objection that it is often
difficult to interpret the reactions, specifically the *absence of*
reactions, to written online communications. 

The reasoning goes like this: if you inform someone of something in a
face-to-face conversation, there is practically no way for them *not*
to provide some sort of feedback. Even if the recipient of a verbal
message doesn’t say a word, they usually exhibit some unconscious,
nonverbal reaction, which can carry a whole load of information:

* The person might smile, light up, and become actively engaged,
* they might express surprise (pleasant or unpleasant),
* they may show signs of dismay or annoyance, or even anger,
* they might just stare or wander off, indicating disconnection or
  indifference,
* or anything in between.

In online, textual communications, people obviously *also* exhibit all
those reactions, sitting at their desk, lounging on their couch,
walking with their phone — it’s just that the sender of the message
usually never gets to see them. 

In addition, a face-to-face conversation is a one-to-one communication
mode that we direct our undivided attention to. In contrast, textual
online communications are often many-to-many, and we usually get many
more parallel inputs than we do when we’re speaking to a colleague or
acquaintance or friend.

That means that while in a face-to-face conversation we’re *always*
answering, or at least showing our reaction to what was said, in online
textual communications we must *pick and choose* what to react to, and
what to just absorb without providing any kind of feedback to the
message sender.


## Warnock’s Dilemma

In online communities this has been known since at least 2000, when
Bryan Warnock
[formulated](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/2000/08/msg1127.html)
it as “the ostrich theory”, although it eventually [was
named](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2001/02/msg2562.html)
“Warnock’s Dilemma”[^pentalemma] by Dave Mitchell. Writing about
mailing list posts without replies, Bryan wrote:

[^pentalemma]: To his credit, Dave points out in the same
    message that “dilemma” is technically inappropriate as the problem
    described includes five choices, not two. It’s properly a
    [pentalemma](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pentalemma).

In asynchronous and distributed work communications, we have much the
same issue. The beautifully crafted [five-paragraph
briefing]({filename}this-meeting-should-have-been-an-email.md) that
you sent out this morning may have been considered manna from heaven
by your recipients (if you’re a manager, your recipients are usually
your direct reports), and they immediately sprung into action
energized by your electrifying leadership. Or maybe nobody understood
a word of the unintelligible drivel you concocted, but out of respect
or courtesy they are very hesitant to point this out.

So in my humble opinion, there are two very simple things you can do
as a manager to address Warnock’s Dilemma in your distributed team:
making it a habit to specifically encourage objections, and
establishing a culture of acknowledgements.

## Encouraging objections

The habit I have developed to encourage objections is to not merely
ask the recipients of a message to raise questions if they have them,
but to ask them to poke holes in whatever I’ve been writing.

To that end, I have standing phrases that I use, such as:

* “Do you think that sounds reasonable?”
* “Did I overlook something important?”
* “Can you think of a better way to do this?” (Better than my
  suggestion, that is.)
* “I’m pretty sure I’m missing something here, can you pitch in?”
* “Am I way out in left field with this?”
* “How nuts of an idea is this?”

I might use a variation on one or several of these phrases at the end
of an email, but also in the comments section of a wiki page (or in
individual inline comments), or even in the reply thread of an issue
tracker.

This serves multiple purposes:

1. There are many individual areas of knowledge where someone on my
   team is more of an expert than I am. Obviously, I want those
   people’s ideas on the table.
2. It establishes the notion that nobody’s opinions or suggestions on
   technical matters are sacrosanct, and we want to do *the right
   thing* in any situation, not follow the hippo.[^hippo]
3. It encourages others to ask for feedback in the same manner,
   whenever they float ideas or suggestions of their own.
4. It establishes that there’s nothing wrong with being wrong from
   time to time.

[^hippo]: HiPPO: the Highest-Paid Person’s Opinion. Following the
    hippo is when you value ideas and opinions by seniority of their
    originator, not by correctness or factual merit.

## Acknowledgements

So now, on to acknowledgements, that is, what to do when you have *no*
objections on something.

Here’s a general rule that I use: **all communications should be
acknowledged.** Yes, really. Anything my team sends me, I try to reply
to with at least “ack” or “OK”, but frequently it’s something like
“great, thanks!” — it costs nothing to be kind.

Likewise, for everything I send *to* my team I can count on getting
the same kind of reply back. There’s something I need to pass on from
higher up? Or just something I want everyone to know? Out goes an
email, in come a few “ack” replies over the next few hours. I don’t
even have to specifically ask anyone for acknowledgement anymore, it
just happens.[^guidelines]

[^guidelines]: We’ve also codified this in my team’s communications
    guidelines. You don’t have something like that? Write them.

In this context, we deliberately use *written* acknowledgements — as
in, somebody actually *types* something, even if it’s just the two
letters “OK”. I find Like buttons or thumbs-up or email “read
receipts” (anyone remember those?) oddly perfunctory.

This has a nice side effect, in combination with encouraging
objections: someone who — while knowing that objections are always
encouraged — acknowledges an idea, opinion, or plan, *actually makes
it clear that they are on board with it.*
