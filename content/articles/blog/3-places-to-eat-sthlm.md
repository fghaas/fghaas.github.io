Summary: Getting hungry in Stockholm?

Continuing the series of selecting 3 places to eat at random in a major city, here is the entry for Stockholm.

These were collected on a recent trip to [PyCon Sweden](https://pycon.se), and as a result are all around [Slussen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slussenomr%C3%A5det) on [Södermalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B6dermalm) (the island just south of the [Old Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamla_stan)).

## Omnipollos Hatt

[Hökens gata 1A](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rRffAfpXfzCKC7CLA)

Solid craft beer bar with incredible pizza, and I don't say that lightly.
Somewhat crowded even on a weeknight, but well worth it --- and if you're not feeling social, they have takeaway.

Apparently, if you happen to arrive during the week that Swedes call "summer", you can also sit on tables curbside.

## La Neta

[Östgötagatan 12B](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B12qDxhphb5LMxPZA)

Totally random find that turned out to be a seriously terrific taquería.
This is one of [three locations](https://laneta.se/) across the city, and they [also do takeout](https://laneta.qopla.com/).

Excellent tacos and quesadillas, with a small selection of Mexican beers.

## Tabbouli

[Tavastgatan 22](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dvx5vodsy87e4DM79)

Absolutely sublime Lebanese place, more upscale than the other two spots I've listed here.
Also in [three more locations](https://tabbouli.eu/) around Stockholm.

Their entire menu is exquisite, though I am a particular fan of their [kibbeh nayyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh_nayyeh) and hummus kawarma. That said, they have plenty of excellent non-meat options too.
