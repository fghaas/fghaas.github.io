Summary: 

Some meetings, I hear, are essential.
(If *all* your meetings are essential, you are in [Meeting Hell](), and you may want to consider getting out.)

And when you take or call an "essential" meeting, you had better make it count.
The way you do is by creating a proper record of the meeting.

Some people call this record the meeting "minutes", but I feel that in order to be called that, the record of the meeting must be a proper play-by-play retelling of the proceedings.
Ideally, in meeting minutes, the key statements made by meeting attendees would be recorded word-for-word, by a stenographer.
This is hardly practical in day-to-day communications.

Thus, my preferred term for this kind of record is, simply, "meeting notes".

All my meetings have a designated note-taker.
Frequently, I am that note-taker myself, in meetings where I am neither the chair nor the primary information source.

Now, there is something important about note-taking: you do it **for the people who are not in the meeting.**

This is to say that the meeting notes don't act as a memory aid to help people remember what they, or the colleague they were talking to, said.
Rather, they act as a full and complete record of anything of value, so that people don't need to remember what was said.

From this follows this general rule: it is not the spoken word that counts in the meeting, but the written one.
**What's not written down, did not happen.**
