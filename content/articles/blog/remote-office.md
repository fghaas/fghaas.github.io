In a recent [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) discussion, [Martin Seeger](https://blog.literarily-starved.com/2013/10/contact/author/) [accidentally](https://mastodon.social/@masek@infosec.exchange/111313672170823374) coined the phrase "remote office".
About which [I then mused](https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi/111313536756727452) that it describes perfectly what's wrong in far too many organizations:
that they think they can get away with all the anti-productive nonsense they've been doing in offices for decades, but now with a bunch of remotees.

So, dear reader who (at least frequently, if not permanently) works from home, do you surmise you might be working in a remote office?
I have a few questions you might want to think about.

* If you get pulled into video meetings with no advance notice and no chance to prepare, yanking you out of whatever you're doing, like someone shouting down the hallway from a conference room something like "Alex, could you just come in here for a moment?", you might be working in a remote office.

* If managers direct-message you in the company text chat demanding your attention **now,** like a shoulder-tapping "management by walking around" amateur, you might be working in a remote office.

* If, in the event of some important news breaking, your head honcho calls everyone into an ad-hoc all-hands video meeting rather than sitting down to write a [5-paragraph email]({filename}../resources/presentations/devopsdaysberlin-2022.md) reflecting functional literacy, you might be working in a remote office.

* If it's tolerated for people to ignore information circulated ahead of a discussion, and to come into it blissfully unprepared expecting to be brought up to speed by other participants who did prepare, you might be working in a remote office.

* If everyone is [stuck in meeting hell]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell.md) and hates it, and people at the top aren't doing anything [to fix it]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell-executives.md), you might be working in a remote office.

* If it's somehow considered acceptable for people to drop comments in a long issue tracker thread that start with "I didn't read the whole thing but here's my take", you might be working in a remote office.

* If you have some middle manager insisting that he[^he] is expected to "lead, not read", you might be working in a remote office.

[^he]: I use "he" here because in 20 years I have never heard anything like this from someone who wasn't a man.

* If managers insist on a [daily scrum]({filename}fragile-development.md) or standup or similar abomination, you might be working in a remote office.

* If managers get all uneasy at the idea of not being able to monitor everyone's being "at work" for whatever definition thereof they apply, you might be working in a remote office.

* If not nearly enough people have any grasp of the importance of [acknowledgment]({filename}warnock-dilemma.md) in communication, you might be working in a remote office.

* If somebody extolls the necessity of socializing with your work mates, you might be working in a remote office.

* If all coordination at your multinational company explodes in a massive fireball twice a year around daylight saving time changes, [instead of everyone just using UTC year-round]({filename}brown-mms.md), you might be working in a remote office.

* If your organization's idea of documentation is "ask Joe" or whoever the longest-serving technically capable member of staff is, you might be working in a remote office.

And in that case, [here's something else you might want to read]({filename}make-my-company-distributed.md).
