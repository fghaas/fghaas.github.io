Summary: Find yourself peckish in Firenze? I can help.

A recent trip to PyCon Italia prompts me to add the Tuscan capital to this series.

## Da' Vinattieri

[Via Santa Margherita, 6R, Firenze](https://osm.org/go/xdQQAmTx5--?m=)

Over-the-counter street food. Lorenzo the local tour guide recommended
this as his go-to place for
[lampredotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampredotto), and who am I
to second-guess him?

## Pompi

[Via Faenza, 37R, Firenze](https://osm.org/go/xdQQBC3Eh?m=&node=2361839042)

Tiny corner café. Has an incredible selection of tiramisù, of which
the salted caramel variety is my favourite (though of course, the
classic recipe is exquisite too).

## l'Pizzachiere

[Via San Miniato, 2, San Niccolò](https://osm.org/go/xdQFXADtc?m=&node=2361718006)

Casual sit-down or takeaway with delicious pizza. Public seating is available just uphill, making this an excellent source for your pizza picnic.

## Special mention: Mercato centrale

[Piazza del Mercato Centrale, 4](https://osm.org/go/xdQQBMMlJ?m=&node=5188361676)

Gigantic market building on two floors, where the ground floor is the market proper (which does have prepared-food outlets as well).
Technically open until 5, but many shops close earlier.

The upper floor, in contrast, is a food mecca that is open from morning until midight with an endless variety of options.
