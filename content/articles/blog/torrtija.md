Summary: A dessert I made up.

This is a dessert that's an excellent use for some stale bread and an apple that's lost its crunch.

I don't think I'm the first person to come up with this, but I did make it up by myself so if there's someone else to credit, I wouldn't know whom.

I call this a torrtija because it looks like a cross of a [torrija](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrija) (usually called "French toast" in English, though the French call it pain perdu or "lost bread"; go figure) with a [tortilla española](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortilla_de_patatas).
And the whole mashup looks something like a [Tarte des Demoiselles Tatin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarte_Tatin).

## Ingredients

Amounts are for 4 dessert servings.

* 1 stale bread roll or brioche bun (pretty much anything based on wheat flour will do)
* 2 eggs, whole
* 100 ml milk
* 50g butter
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar (optional)
* 1 large apple

## Equipment

* 1 medium-size bowl
* Cooking knife and board
* Whisk
* Small skillet


## Method

1. Whisk the eggs and milk together in the bowl.

2. Cut the bread into pieces, roughly 2×2×2 cm.

3. Toss the bread into the bowl and mix thoroughly. Set the bowl aside for 15-20 minutes so the bread soaks in the egg wash.

4. Meanwhile, peel and core the apple. Cut it in half and then cut into thin slices.

5. When the bread is done soaking, melt the butter in the pan on medium heat. Optionally, sprinkle the sugar on the bottom of the pan.

6. Lay the apple slices on the bottom of the pan, covering it.

7. Using a large spoon or your clean bare hands, cover the apple slices with the bread/egg mix.

8. Put a lid on the pan, and cook on low to medium heat for about 10 minutes. The steam from the apples will cook the mixture almost through.

9. If necessary, gently loosen the pan's contents from the pan using a spatula. Try not to break it up.

10. Cover the pan with an upside-down plate, press down on it with one hand while holding the panhandle in the other, and flip it so the plate, now right way up, ends up on the bottom. Set the plate down. You should now be able to lift off the pan.

11. Either serve the dessert on one communal plate for everyone to tuck in, or cut it into 4 slices and serve on small plates. Optionally, add a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.
