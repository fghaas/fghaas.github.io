Title: Offsites that don't suck

Summary: At work we have an annual offsite. It's very much unlike such things I've seen in other companies.

Where I work, the company's composition has changed quite dramatically
since I joined, nearly 5 years ago. What was originally a company that
worked from two offices — both in Sweden and one *significantly* larger
than the other — has grown into a reasonably distributed company with
60 employees spread across multiple countries.

As anyone who runs such a company knows, you want to bring people
together face to face, at least about once or twice a year. Now obviously
we haven't been able to do that for two years, but in early June of
this year we were able to reconvene in the same place where we'd last
met, in the pre-pandemic summer of 2019.

What we do there amounts to a 3-day gathering that is very much not your
typical company offsite.

Work on our company unconference starts months in advance, with our colleagues
Özgür, Thomas, and Catarina planning the logistics, and hashing out
the budget with our powers-that-be. Then, about 3-4 months prior to the
event we get a friendly notification that there's a page on our internal
wiki with the event details, suggestions for travel planning, and the
call for proposals.

## What do we talk about?

Proposals for the unconference slots are quite simple and informal: you
put down your name, and a very brief title and abstract of what you're
planning to talk about. It's nothing fancy, just two columns in a table
on a wiki page. The third column is to express your interest in a
talk someone else is proposing. You simply put down your name and that says,
"I'd like to listen to that!" There are no rules as to how many talks
you can or should express interest in, nor is there any expectation for
someone to propose a topic. Topics are usually work-related but needn't
pertain to a particular issue or problem we're currently dealing with — if
you bring a crazy idea that sufficiently many people are interested in,
then maybe that idea isn't so crazy after all.

In addition to talk proposals for the conference programme, we also put
in ideas for free-time activities. Now these are *entirely* non-work-related
and can be about any topic you are interested in. We've had lock picking
sessions, photography workshops, kayak trips, the works.

## Where are we?

"Kayak trips?" I hear you say. Yes, maybe I should say a word or two about
the location. We're on an island. As in, we literally occupy an island,
a tiny one in the Blekinge Archipelago in southern Sweden. It's a place that
has a tiny natural harbour with a boat dock, a restaurant, a gift shop,
simple but perfectly agreeable accommodation, and a conference area, all
spread out short walking distances apart in little houses properly painted
in Falu red. There is no road access to the island; transport is by a
20-minute ferry hop from the mainland. We're usually not the only guests;
there might be one or two other groups on the island at the same time.
But we're normally the largest group.

It's really a quite beautiful location. I hear it *can* be somewhat
tricky when the summer happens to be a wet one and the mosquitoes are
out in force, but thankfully we've always been very lucky with the
weather so far and some light fog and drizzle were the worst we had
to endure.

A former colleague of mine has described the atmosphere as "like camp"
(as a teenager), "but without the bullying."

## What doesn't happen?

Which brings me to a few things that make our conference good because
they *don't* happen (besides bullying).

We steer clear of "motivational", "team-building" exercises because there's
a general consensus in the company that they're a load of rubbish. Instead,
we get to talk about things that we care and tend to know a lot about, and
discuss good ideas in a generally respectful and appreciative manner. If
that's not motivational and good for teams, I don't know what is.

We're also a company that's remarkably devoid of assholes, which probably
reflects favorable on our hiring and retention practices.

And, related to the above, nobody takes the conferences as an invitation to
get hammered. We don't have an alcohol ban, but instead there is a two-drink
limit with dinner. If you want to drink anything more, the staff will
relieve you of your hard earned kronor at the bar (and it's Sweden, so you'll
be parting with quite a few of those). The fact that there's only one source
of alcohol on the island helps too, as there are no options for extended bar
or pub crawls.
