Title: About me (and this site)

Slug: about

I’ve worked pretty much exclusively with open source software since about the time I graduated from college in 2003.
I worked at a small outfit out of Vienna called ADS-System, which was then [acquired](https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20050404_OTS0022/kapsch-businesscom-kauft-ads-system-ausbau-des-geschaeftsbereichs-it-und-netzwerkloesungen) by [Kapsch BusinessCom](https://www.kapsch.net/kbc).
I then went to work for [LINBIT](https://www.linbit.com) for about 4½ years, and co-founded hastexo with my partners Martin Loschwitz and Andreas Kurz in 2011. 
We parted ways 3 years in, and 3 years after _that_ I [sold hastexo](https://www.citynetwork.eu/pressreleases/city-network-shifts-high-gear-hastexo-acquisition/) to City Network AB. 
Then, in 2022, City Network [rebranded as Cleura](https://cleura.com/press-releases/city-network-becomes-cleura/).

At Cleura I currently serve as Head of Education, and I also offer classes and workshops at [Linuxhotel](https://www.linuxhotel.de/). I am available for training and consulting services through Haas as a Service GmbH (HaaS), a one-person company incorporated in Austria.

Some of the content on this site was originally hosted on `hastexo.com`, was not carried over onto the City Cloud/Cleura web site, and I’ve resurrected it here based on popular demand and for reference purposes.
Such content is clearly spelled out as such at the bottom of the respective pages.
Regardless, **I work on this site in my spare time** (which is also why articles tend to appear here on weekends) **and you should not mistake anything on this site as official pronouncements of any organisations that I am or ever was affiliated with.**

Most of the articles on this site cover technical issues, largely around [OpenStack](/tag/openstack.html), [Open edX](/tag/open-edx.html), and [Ceph](/tag/ceph.html) — but there’s also a sprinkling of [Python](/tag/python.html) content and other topics.
Some are write-ups of [conference](/tag/conference.html) talks.
Some articles are about how people [work](/tag/work.html).

> Hey, can I ask you a favour? If you quote me by full name, I’d *really* appreciate if you got my name right. 
> My surname is *Haas*, not “Hass”, and it does irk me a little bit when someone misspells my name to the thing that in my language refers to [the worst and most useless emotion of all](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hass#Noun).
> Thank you!
